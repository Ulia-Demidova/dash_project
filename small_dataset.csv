78909,":This issue has been dealt with. But, suffice it to say, the interest of wikipedia is to present the truth (the theory being that enough contributors can arrive at the truth through consensus). If something is objectively true, and yet is disputed (for example, the existence of the Holocaust), then it is not the job of wikipedia to pretend that there is some conflict as to the realities of history. When there was a dispute about a factual matter, and that dispute has been resolved (as is the case here), there is no need whatsoever to pretend that the matters that were the subject of the dispute are still in controversy.  Here we have the latter case: Nobody today contends that Chassidim are lax on halacha, etc. And, indeed, nobody contends today that Chassidim were lax in halacha at any time in history.  Quite the opposite, in fact. Those attacks have been universally recognized as false.  To pretend, for the sake of NPOV, that the untruth of the aforementioned attacks is in question is foolish."

You also refuse to put any of those so called reliable sources before me so that we can together decide whether those sources actually claim that Office Open XML is not a free and ope nstandard or whether or not the claims in it still apply to the current ISO/IEC standard. Cliam in the past were well known to rely on statements that the format was only implemented by Micrsoft (which is of course long in the past), that Microsoft controlled the format (currently both the ownership and maintenance of ISO/IEC 29500 Office open XML are within ISO/IEC JTC1) or that the standard referred to not fully defined item (for which informatio nwas added during the ISO standardization proces). So we can in fact easily see if any old claims still apply but the refused to bring forth those arguments and see if they apply to the ISO/IEC standard is shocking. You claim consensus on a viewpoint that you then refuse to support with actual claims/arguments. I claim that it is enough for an ISO/IEC standard to be publicy availalbe free or charge and royalties to be called a free and open standard. That alone complies with the definitions given on the relevant wikipedia articles. Unless you put forward real arguments (and not some consensus on imaginary non-existing arguments) that these definitions are not met by the ISO/IEC 29500 standard I will readd the claim to the article."

These 'sins' (in the eyes of old order ACCA) have deeply divided the church.  The fact these acts are even considered to be sinful speak volumes to the erroneous beliefs of the ACCA. Other 'sins' include sports (participation and as a spectator), movies (even G-rated), attending another church (my parents would not even attend their grandsons' graduation recognitions), and wearing jewelry.  Some are still clinging to these beliefs to the point where the elder of the Lamar, Missouri church would not allow the youth there to congregate with youth from certain other ACCA churches because he believed they would be led astray.  I have attended a number of churches of other denominations.  At each church I was warmly welcomed and invited to worship as I saw fit.  What a contrast this was in comparison to growing up in the ACCA.  All I heard was what was not allowed and straying from the teachings of the church leadership would lead to an eternity in hell.  The good news is the ACCA is losing membership in droves as their extremist views are challenged by members willing to read the bible and make decisions regarding their salvation on their own instead of relying on the flawed teachings of man.

As a result, it is inaccurate to make any concrete claims about the frequency or rarity of any victims or rapists.

 == Undone edits by user: Ibn khaldun 84 == 

 The following was moved do discussion because it was not in encyclopedic style and had few citations.  Also, citations were not in proper format. 

 == Other modern Modifications of Kondratieff theory == 

 === The contest of Political Long Cycles vs. Economic Long Cycles === 

 The theory of long cycles tend to generate much debate during periods of so-called """"recessions"""", while during the long periods of growth decreases instead the intensity of the debate. Since the 1970s and above 1980s, the discussions increased quite hugely, when they were relatively faded between 1945 and 1970. It is questionable whether the period since 1967 (Meadows Report), or 1971 (end of gold convertibility of the dollar) or 1973 (oil shocks) is a long recession. The US economy has experienced strong productivity gains and a period of economic growth in length as yet unknown, from the years 1980s. As for Asia, this continent started to take off ever since. But Europe has actually experienced the problems of mass unemployment and slower growth since the 1970s. Yet the theory of long cycles then experienced an upturn, but in all over directions than before. These long cycles would be not economic, but also political. It is not only cycles of political views, but cycles involving the world via their geopolitical dimension. And Modelski (1983) and Goldstein (1988) are interpreting and completing the Kondratiev results. In parallel with Kondratiev economic long waves, exist in parallel hegemonic cycles. Hegemonic cycle lasts two successive Kondratiev cycles (120 years) by Modelski, or between two and three cycles (150 years) by Goldstein. 

 === Neo-Schumpeterian Approaches vs. World System Approaches === 

 In fact, in Europe itself, the theory of hegemonic long cycles initiated notably by Modelski and Goldstein, has long had less success in starting a debate in Universities, than the theories about economic long cycles lasting approximately 50 years. The real debate has often opposed rather - since the 1970s and especially 1980s - neo-Schumpeterian on one hand, with advocates of the theory of the World System on the other hand. It is true though that the World System Approach accepts more the idea of a possible existence of political long cycles. Among the neo-Schumpeterian, Kleinknecht conducted audits of the econometric theory of Kondratiev, country by country, and concludes we can consider this theory as widely tested empirically. On the other hand, proponents of the theory of the World System note that this theory does not oppose only developed countries on one hand, developing countries on the other side. It is also showed, in developed countries themselves, the presence of growing inequalities in income and endowment factors, between neighboring regions: through the establishment of systems for the construction of suitable qualifications, the long cycle and the global system naturally spread inequalities locally, according to the international division of labor. Gerhard Mensch's works can be proved to be in part as a link between these theories. On the one hand he argues for a neo-Schumpeterian explanation of the long cycles of innovation. On the other hand, since it explains that innovations through credit systems adapted to recognize the global evolution, may exist in periods of expansion like in recession periods, it justifies the fact that innovations can be supported by the public sector, for example in a recession and to increase the average skill level. 

 === Methodological Enquiries === 

 Assume that the findings made in the early days of the theory of economic long cycles (early twentieth century and even a little before) show points of support to build statistical systems, that are conceived in order to verify the theory. What are these points of support? On the one hand, the various economic sectors vehicle some productivity differentials. Thanks to the knowledge of these differentials... we could understand how the credit spreads from a sector of the economy to another to feed growth. But if we reason, not taking into account the sectoral point of view, but rather from a national perspective, we will not have that subtelty. It is this subtelty that allows the construction of econometric systems to resolve the question. If we can understand the phenomenon of growth only nationally is one possibility; there economy and law are used to walk closely together. But it must go global to move towards the solution in terms of the method how to conceptually integrate the global innovation? Should it be, to hope to achieve, and solve, again... a question of method! Indeed, early theories of long cycles rather studied the issue of price changes for each country, and also in some respects suggested modest ways to incorporate the issue of quantity or income. Now if we come to the world"
140166,""" 

 The new intro is a nice improvement. I agree with Melcombe about scope (and much else). Some issues I think could be cleared up 
 * Saying non-parametric means """"very few"""" assumptions seems to vague; one could say that assuming a classical linear model is just one assumption. I appreciate that it looks very abstract, but the finite-dimensional restriction is in van der Vaart and Cox [Prinicples book] - and probably lots of other places too. Perhaps a little more in the way of examples would help? 
 * Simple random sampling is an assumption that can be made in fully- semi- and non-parametric models. So it's perhaps not best to state it as the sole example in the non-parametric bullet. 
 * The randomization-based models section should start with something to orient the reader. For example, """"An important experimental situation where strong assumptions are well-motivated is the randomized study"""". Then say how inference proceeds. Then compare randomization-based inference to other approaches. 
 * """"warrants"""" is nowhere near the right word. 
 * False models and pi=22/7 is a bizarre comparison. Anyone can see 22/7 is not Pi. It would be an overstatement to ridicule assuming classical linear models because they're not true. (n.b. I would rather not include the Box mantra on models and usefulness, it's hackneyed and quoted as support by people with very different stances) 
 * Information and computational complexity - doesn't mention inference anywhere, so not obviously relevant 
 * Fiducial/Lindley - Lindley (1958) didn't show fiducial inference """"fails"""", he showed that it didn't correspond to a Bayesian procedure - this isn't quite the same. Don Fraser has written about this (well).   """

 I have to wonder, Ibadibam, are we trying to share information, or are we trying to make an inflammatory political statement? Facts are facts. Snipping comments and/or statements to adhere to a more negative, less factual slant isn't particularly helpful. However, a simple set of quotation marks, is. So, your correction was corrected.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •    
 :I recognize that there's a lot of sensitivity around this company right now due to recent politics, and I would like to assure you that I am in no way trying to defame this topic, but working in good faith to improve the quality of the article. The phrase """"who eventually recovered with no ill effects"""" is taken directly from the source, but that source does not attribute that information to anyone. It also does not clarify what kind of """"ill effects"""" were avoided. Did the child merely suffer no ill medical effects, or did the family also avoid ill psychological and financial effects resulting from the illness? I have added another citation that indicates a complete recovery, attributed to the child's physician. I think this information that is better sourced and more specific, and have used that in the article.   """

I did a similar section on the Don't Look Now article, and found film reviews or interviews with the director to be the best secondary sources for establishing the importance of these cultural references. The main thing there though, was that I tried as much as possible to avoid citing the referring film itself.

Science fiction is largely based on writing rationally about alternative possible worlds or futures.[2] It is similar to, but differs from, fantasy in that, within the context of the story, its imaginary elements are largely possible within scientifically established or scientifically postulated laws of nature (though some elements in a story might still be pure imaginative speculation). Wikipedia, article on Science fiction. 

 It therefore seems to me that the heading 'Science fiction elements"""" is erroneous, and at least some, and probably all, of the matters considered under that heading should be under a 'Fantasy Elements' heading instead.

 Hesperian's guesses about an editor's motives are irrelevant.  The only question is whether the material added by the editors was relevant, informative, and documented.  The reviews of Hart's poetry and Hart's own views of poetry and his fellow poets are all relevant, informative, and documented.  Therefore this material should stand.  Hesperian needs to back down and stop policing articles about which he admittedly knows nothing at all.  Let those who know something about poetry and scholarship have their say.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 I quote from the NPOV/FAQ page: """"Lack of neutrality as an EXCUSE to delete. 
 The neutrality policy is used sometimes as an excuse to remove text that is perceived as biased. Isn't this a problem?  In many cases, yes. Many editors believe that bias is not in itself reason to remove text, because in some articles all additions are likely to express bias. Instead, material that balances the bias should be added, and sources should be found per WP:V. Material that violates WP:NOR should be removed.""""   

 This policy makes a strong case that the possible """"bias"""" of the editor's additions to the Kevin Hart article should stand.  Any editor who finds bias has the burden of adding material to balance this perceived bias.  Hesperian and others need to stand down and either leave the article on Hart alone or add documented and relevant material of their own. 

 Let me add that Hesperian has continued to accuse me of sock-puppetry (note that his/her diatribe begins """"I don't know what Hart did to piss this person off""""), which is a ridiculous delusion.  There have been at least four editors that have been involved in the development of this piece.  I restored edits made by another editor because I agreed with that him/her that the article is valid and informed.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 == Stubbing and semi-protection an abuse of authority == 

 Hesperian semi-protected and stubbed this article after someone posted Hart's own published comments on a fellow Australian poet. I cannot fathom how removing this material is a gesture of neutrality. Now the article is left with bits of praise, with no real sense of who Hart is. That's what is missing now. Who Hart really is, and how the academic community perceives him, is the basis for an excellent article. Was the piece excellent before Hesperian stubbed it? No, but we were all working on getting it there, and at least it was informative (until Hesperian stubbed it), and anyone who felt the piece lacked balance was free to add strong and positive reviews of Hart's work. Hesperian has deleted well-researched, accurately documented, informative material about Hart, material that was not available anywhere else on the web. Significantly, it was material that was submitted by several editors, not just one.  (Moreover, Hesperian has continued to make accusations of sock-puppetry, which is a ridiculous delusion. There have been at least four editors that have been involved in the development of this piece. I restored edits made by another editor because I agreed with that him/her that the article is valid and informed.)  Hesperian's stub amounts to a hatchet job on what was growing slowly into a well-rounded and important analysis of a highly successful poet and critic. Such an article needs both positive and negative reviews if it is to have any validity at all. Some of that material might not flatter Kevin Hart, but so what? Is it Wikipedia's purpose to flatter? If so, it has no reliability. Please bear in mind that all deleted material was well-documented and was originally published in scholarly, peer-reviewed presses. In my view, Hesperian has abused this system, and his actions border on vandalism. You should look closely at the article's contents the day Hesperian stubbed it. The inappropriate comments about Hart that he cites had been deleted long, long ago. 

 Hesperian's guesses about an editor's motives are irrelevant. The only question is whether the material added by the editors was relevant, informative, and documented. The reviews of Hart's poetry and Hart's own views of poetry and his fellow poets are all relevant, informative, and documented. Therefore this material should stand.

They were not opinions or agenda driven observations, they were actual recordings of ACTION.  You just do not like the source, which is funny because over half of America distrusts the Ny Times and Washington Post (PEW Research poll, November 08, 2012)- which you allow.   

 As for the rest of your rambling diatribe: keep telling yourself that Wiki is a respected source and that no university allows encyclopedia references...  That is a complete absurdity and we both know it.  I am a university professor, and you couldn't be further from the truth.  Encyclopedic references are specifically allowed within the context of general information.  But it matters not as my exercise was mere fabrication.   

 This whole episode was a performance, in public, to explain to 3 of my students why they received failing grades on a project where they used the Wiki as a source.  I couldn't care any less about Martin Bashir; he's just another extremist talking head, no different than Glen Beck, Rush Limbaugh or Rachel Maddow.  He was selected for the example because he was the guy on the TV when the students came in my office to make their case.  Our University excludes Wikipedia exclusively due to it's abject inaccuracy on practically every subject where """"general consensus"""" holds a particular bias.  My initial examples were the subjects of: race, religion, political affiliation, perceived bias, climate change and economic recovery.  We randomly selected four of the categories and designed the experiment to provide an accurate result.  In every category, each of us attempted to insert ACTION (defined as the actual events) into the wiki page corresponding to the category, from a referenced source, but from a source with perceived bias against the general consensus bias.  All of the links and verbiage were approved by the dept. and student advisory board, and, determined to be entirely accurate.  Those were the rules...  Had any two been successful, they would have gotten a """"B"""" on their project.  All four failed.  Luckily for them, I am kind and gave them 25 extra credit points for this """"test"""" so their project grades didn't kill them (academically). 

 Our standards and practices board ruled, """"Wikipedia is entirely for entertainment purposes and serves only to reinforce the views of the general consensus.""""  Due to that ruling, Our University physics dept. has renewed it's exclusion of Wikipedia as a source to be cited on anything- graded or not.

 March 31st, 2008, Bill Clinton was in Salem, Oregon campaigning for his wife in Building 50 (winema place on Chemeketa), where the entire building was full and they wouldn't let more people in. I was almost there and was told I couldn't go in. Most people just left after that, but I stayed and good thing, because they set up ropes so that after Clinton's speech, he could come out and shake hands and all that. So, I was right in front, behind the ropes. When I finally got to shake his hand, I told him I liked his watch, and he said """"I got it from my daughter's boyfriend.""""

I agree, it does not need to be neither academical, nor should everything be proved. C´mon friends? Didn't Aikido became popular in the west mainly because of Seagal's movies? All I'm saying is that perhaps you could add something about Aikido hitting the big screens, since this IS part of Aikido history in the west, and one of the main reasons for the dissemination of the art in the west. I repeat, you don't have to mention Seagal's name whatsoever, but Aikido on the screens through his movies is a fact. And c'mon, let's face it. Isn't it a cool fact? Isn't it a very occidental fact? Aikido on the movies? It's just great that Aikido got known MAINLY through the cinema. If you guys are not willing to face this truth, what else can I say.

 Dear Cobi, 

 My name is Jonathan Obar , I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the communityHERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students. 

  
 So a few things about the interviews: 
 * Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes. 
 * Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.) 
 * All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so. 
 * All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time. 
 * The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly. 

  
 Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name instead. 

 If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you. 

 Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you. 

 Sincerely, 

 Jonathan Obar"

You should be able to find these numbers on the internets if you use the google. Assuming the hydride is sodium hydride (NaH), the product would be sodium hydroxide, and the energy released by the reaction NaH + ½O2 → NaOH would be approximately equal to [ΔHf(NaOH) - ΔHf(NaH)]. That number, which should be negative, represents the amount energy released by the reaction (under standard conditions), and its absolute value is the maximum amount of energy that would be possible to extract from the system. Of course, the whole hydride to wheels spinning energy transfer is not 100% efficient, so there would actually be somewhat less energy available to run the car.

 After my recent XF-104 tribulations I just had a good read through this article again. It looks like it needs a good clean up before anything else is added, some of it is very good (operators) and some of it is quite bad (pilot impressions).  
 With the XF-104 article apparently staying I would propose to shorten the development part as the text is duplicated to some extent (I did say I had copied it over) and add a sub heading for YF-104A development programme which was the real start of the F-104 in service to replace the missing development text(to be expanded in good time). Instead of 'design' perhaps 'technical description' of the typical F-104G would be better. 
 A new section on 'safety record' to merge the existing comments and work on it to put the figures in to context. From my research the majority of Luftwaffe accidents were CFIT (controlled flight into terrain) or engine exhaust nozzle failures followed by the usual bird strikes, spatial disorientation etc. Can we put a 'pie chart' in to illustrate this? I have a list of every German accident and its cause for instance which might open some eyes. Have to say thanks to all the contributors along the way but the article has become fairly messy. Last thought, you can always revert if you want to! Cheers

 :::Just about done the production table in the sandbox, should go in soon, would like to do another for the operators, hopefully it is not too much info. The worse bit is the Pilot impressions section, I have several accounts of the actual handling qualities (one from Roland Beamont who didn't like it), once it's tidied a bit there needs to be a new section on 'Safety record' or something similar where the facts can be shown. I really don't like the nicknames section either although many of those names are accepted, perhaps it needs better referencing (I have no reference to the Italian names apart from 'Spillone' which I believe is 'hatpin' for instance). There is no mention of the ZELL (Zero Length Launch) programme which is fascinating. I think this article could be a GA with some work. Cheers

I can't find anything on it in WP unless I am looking in the wrong place. Was quite a significant program I would guess. I am toying with the idea of changing the operator air force names to their own language equivalents (Koninklijke Luchtmacht for the Netherlands for instance). It won't work for all of them, is there a convention?    

 :::::Good work so far, Nimbus. It's amazing what can happen when disruptive influences are finally removed. As to operator name language, the usual convention has been to use English equivelants, as in most cases that is also the name of the article on said operator. The notable execption is Luftwaffe. I see no problem, however, listing the native language equivelant at first mention in the text, after the English name. For example: The F-104 was used by the Royal  Netherlands AIr Force (Koninklijke Luchtmacht) from 1234-5678.

While I'm sure the purpose of the WWE is to make the matches seem as real as possible, does it not do the public a disservice to not explicitly state that the events surrounding her life within the WWE are in some cases scripted events?

 :""""Lo! those who disbelieve spend their wealth in order that they may debar (men) from the way of Allah. They will spend it, then it will become an anguish for them, then they will be conquered. And those who disbelieve will be gathered unto hell,""""  

 :""""But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, an seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.""""

 === Remarks on """"Some remarks"""" === 

 I read the technical stuff you wrote just now- some of it is not right. You do NOT get that everything is bosonic by rotating the correlation function- you get exactly spin/statistics independent of whether you use """"P1"""" or """"P2"""". The operator """"R"""" is not what you think it is. It's just a polarization rotation matrix. It could be neither unitary nor antiunitary, because it acts on fields, not on states. It is a very simple polarization rotation matrix, not an operator acting on the Hilbert space of field states. 

 This is why I don't talk about the Minksowski stuff at all. I don't want to talk about anti-unitary or unitary business, which is completely avoidable if you stay in Euclidean space. It becomes all that in Minkowski space, but that is not necessary for understanding spin/statistics. The argument is simple: if you have the correlation function """"Rphi phi"""", then just by rotation it equals -"""" phi R phi"""" for half integer spin. 

 I am well aware that Streater and Whitman use the operator """"lambda"""" which does a full parity reversal on all spatial dimensions, but I don't like it. It doesn't generalize to even number of space dimensions, and secondly it does a second rotation in the y-z plane which is completely irrelevant for the argument. The only possible relevance is to ensure that the proper polarization operator is positive definite, but they don't discuss this point in there, as far as I remember.  """

 ==Move proposal== 

 I propose that Vaníček analysis be moved to Least-squares spectral analysis, a more descriptive, neutral, and widely used and known term for the topic.  The article has a lot of good well-sourced information on a notable topic, but is written in a biased way aimed apparently at making sure that Vaníček is the main name associated with the method, and that the contributions of others are denied or minimized.  It written by a WP:SPA who has not denied that he is Vaníček's ex-student who wrote the thesis that's used as a source to verify such POV statements as that the """"method has been mistakenly called by some the Lomb-Scargle or simply the Lomb method.""""    
 :I am rather surprised by these allegations. First of, you first call me an expert and then YOU arbitrarily pick (out of at least five names for the same method) the one that YOU deem to be """"a more descriptive, neutral, and widely used and known term"""". Here is a perfectly logical explanation for my way of presenting the method's name by using just two references (while stating that the name you selected has many references but without stating those specifically  this doens't mean that the name you picked has more references than the name as I stated it  don't mix apples and oranges!): the reason why I included only the first known (from 1970-ies) and the last known (from 2006) reference that cited the method as Vanicek's, was that I hoped this would have been sufficient for an encyclopedia type of article. If you insist, and if you are some kind of authority as you seem to be, I can provide a reference that calls the method """"Vanicek's"""" for every single year between 1970 and 2007! But why flood the article like that?  Second, why are you assuming that not admitting to be some person means you are actually that person? This makes no sense to me.  Last  before accusing me of making up the word """"mistakenly"""", please do read the reference first, before passing accusations like these. I am not here to be insulted like that. 
 :I appreciate the comment you made on the method authors' biography (I just included the biography source in there, so you should check it). But it seems to me like your contributions to the method article are made not in good faith (not to mention you are not an expert, as you indicated yourself), but in order to say just about anything that comes across your mind. It doesn't seem to me like improvements can be made like that. Please use your powers sparingly. I am here to improve the Wikipedia in the aspect of geodesy, not to waste time and energy fighting you.

I'm proposing we fix that; I don't see why you would question my good faith here; check my contribs history.

 == torture of imprisonment victims == 

 This article needs some mention of sleep deprivation used to torture victims of imprisonment. I believe that is the most widely used intentional application of sleep deprivation. I don't know where to find documentation of this suitable for publication here, but I have some clues:  

 * I saw a documentary that mentioned a 1600's swedish prison schedule that had the prisoners being awakened at 4 AM for breakfast and then being allowed to sleep at about 11 or 12 PM, leaving only a few hours of sleep on a prolonged basis. That's the oldest mention I know of off the top of my head of institutionalized torture using sleep deprivation.  

 * In modern imprisonment facilities, the same thing occurs as in the ancient swedish prison schedule: only a few hours each day are scheduled for prisoner sleep. In addition to the ancient methods, modern prisons also institute regular """"head counts"""" where a prisoner is required to rise from bed and state his name to passing guards. 

 * Bed checks, cell checks, or just """"the rounds"""" are where a guard is sent to personally look into prisoner cells every 5 to 20 minutes. This is done 24 hours a day, and guards frequently kick and rattle or slam the doors, yell at prisoners, yell to each other, sing songs, or otherwise interrupt a prisoner's already short sleep period. 

 * Unnaturally hard beds, harder than even earth or wild grasses, keeps prisoners from sleeping due to discomfort. 

 * Keeping prisoners irritable enlivens boring prison jobs and gives riot suppression teams something to do when prisoners lose the ability to think clearly and make good judgements, which often turns ordinary people into potentially violent ones.  

 * Prisoners who are already mentally ill go from being public nuisances to being raving loonies while deprived of sleep in the prisons. Even ordinary people will begin to hallucinate, leading to charges of insubordination or other misbehavior that the victim would not do without being sleep deprived. 

 * Permanent brain damage causes personality changes universally perceived as negative by those close to imprisonment survivors. Subsequent health problems, including psychological issues like PTSD and depression, are considered contributing factors of recidivism."""

93094,"""::::, thank you for stopping by. Having invited you to mediate, I don't want to be tendentious, but I will attempt a single cycle of checking to make sure you understood my concerns.  The conclusion that """"Only 31% of men prescribed finasteride met the eligiblity criteria for the pivotal trials"""" required two logical steps. 

 :::::1) The authors reviewed the eligibility criteria for the pivotal (pre-approval) clinical trials, and 
 :::::2) They aggregated and interpreted previously unpublished data about men prescribed the drug from the Northwestern University Enterprise Data Warehouse. Specifically, they set criteria for choosing a comparison population (those administered 1.25 mg or less per day) and analyzed the characteristics of this population to determine the frequency of men having conditions that they believed would have excluded them from the aforementioned trials. This gathering and interpreting of unpublished data to my mind represents pretty much the definition of primary research.  

 The latter step involved a number of judgement calls that require review by a secondary source.   
 :::::1) The authors determined """"eligibility"""" by matching the ICD-9 codes of patients from the Northwestern database to relatively vague statements of exclusionary criteria such as """"A history of any illness or condition that might confer additional risk or confound the results"""".  For example, the authors stated that 4.5% of their patients would be ineligible due to obesity, but obesity is not explicitly stated to be an exclusionary criteria for any pre-approval trial.  They presumably decided on their own that obesity """"might confer additional risk"""".    
 :::::2) A secondary source is needed to assess whether the population that these authors analyzed is representative enough to make the study itself significant.  According to Table 2 of the source document, 8.5% of the patients prescribed propecia at Northwestern would have been ineligible for the pivotal trials because they had cancer.  7.1% were ineligible because of substance abuse issues, 27% were ineligible due to heart disease or hypertension, and nearly 17% had """"disorders of the male genital organs"""".  I personally find it it difficult to believe that nearly 10% of those prescribed propecia nationally have cancer.  This seems to me to be primary research in every sense of the word, and in need of a secondary source for interpretation.  

 ::::All these things being said, I invited you to mediate, and will not pursue this issue further should you still disagree with me after reviewing these comments.  ||

 The word fag is continually being used in modern day society as a negative term. It is no longer associated with gay or titties homosexual faggot tendencies. Nowadays """"You are just a fag!"""" has absolutely nothing to do with the sexual tendencies of the person being accused.  

 I suggest this is expanded upon in the article. My son has just accused me of being a fag for writing this. I do not believe I am homosexual.  

 :You're very wrong about that.  It has everything to do with sexuality, that's the whole point of the insult.  You're calling the person a homosexual.  It is not an insult otherwise.

 What's the feeling? Should fag and faggot have different pages or should one redirect to the other? Also, anyone want to help out with this entry?

 Not just American teens - and fag can be used against non homosexuual people - i was apparently a """"fag"""" for being disabled

 Yes, I believe Europeans sometimes call cigarettes """"fags"""". 

 No in Europe generally. It's a British and Irish term.  12:47 Dec 5, 2002 (UTC) 

 :That is, of course, the basis for the joke about the two possible meanings of the phrase """"I'm going to go smoke some fags.""""  12:28 Dec 5, 2002 (UTC) 

 And I think """"faggot"""" is some sort of a plant? 

 :I've heard """"faggot"""" defined as a bundle of sticks, but I wasn't sure that it was appropriate for this entry.  12:20 Dec 5, 2002 (UTC) 

 ::""""faggot"""" is actually an imperial measure for sticks. 
 ::1 short faggot of sticks = 2 ft. girth x 32 in. long bundle of short wood sticks/billets 
 ::1 long faggot of sticks = 2 ft. girth x 4 ft. long bundle of long wood sticks/billets 

 ::1 faggot of iron = 2 ft. girth x 1 ft. long bundle of iron/steel rods/bars for horseshoes & so forth

 :In Britain you can buy a product called """"Brain's faggots"""". Brain's (Brain's website) is the brand name, I don't know of any other manufacturer Faggots are basically meatballs. 

  
 Regarding the usage in British schools... a fag is one who fags? Verb and noun?  01:06 Dec 6, 2002 (UTC) 

 :Yes, I could (if I was a senior boy in an English public school like Eton or Harrow) have a fag. He would be a junior boy (probably a first year) and he would fag for me. He would be doing fagging duties for (maybe) several hours a day or only a few minutes a week depending on how mean I was.

 ::I don't know whether to be frightened or impressed. )  01:26 Dec 6, 2002 (UTC) 

  

 Right now, the article implies that """"fag"""" and """"faggot"""" are not used in British English as  pejorative terms for male homosexual. Is that correct?  21:11 Mar 16, 2003 (UTC) 

 """"Faggot"""" certainly has this meaning in England (with meatballs and bundles of firewood as still current, but slightly old-fashioned senses).  """"Fag"""" is understood as """"cigarette"""" when spoken by a Brit, but is recognized in the US sense when spoken by an American.

It seems that not even the Met Office has an explanation on the site beyond simply saying that it originated in the Bay of Biscay and then deepened. Whether Floyd had anything to do with it is quite questionable being speculative as it is, and the assertion may have its roots (perhaps) in the popular mix-up of the two storms at the time. Being at the ideal position at the Jet Stream though seems like a plausible explanation. The above link at least contains a link to satellite images from formation to dissipation. I guess the only way to know for sure with regards to the relative position of the Jet and the Low would be to look up archived charts for that period - something I don't have immediately available.

 == Radcliffe wikify == 

 Hi Doops,  

 My name is . I'm currently on a editing spree of college-related articles. The reason I added a wikify tag to Radcliffe article was because it does not have the same quality as other college articles. I saw on your user page that you are an alum of Harvard. If you would like to help wikify the Radcliffe article, please see my edits of UMass Amherst. As for your comment as to why I didn't do the editing myself, an article doesn't just become wikified by the insertion of link tags. Even your own Harvard College is far more wikified than the Radcliffe page. 

 In the future, please pose questions as to tags in the Discussion page of the article in question, thanks! 

   (copied from  

 :Hi, Varun. I think you may be misunderstanding the word """"wikify"""". Wikification isn't so much a question of content as of how that content is formatted — in particular, is there a healthy dose of internal wikipedia links? Typically, the """"wikify"""" tag is used for articles with large chunks of undigested text, often cut-and-pasted from the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica or other public domain source. They need formatting, links, and often lots of rewriting to make them encyclopedic in tone. Adding the tag to an article automatically adds it to the huge (currently ca. 2000 articles) Category:Articles that need to be wikified; for the sake of the sanity of the brave souls who try, largely in vain, to rescue articles like this from this category, we should only send articles there which really need it. 

 :As far as article quality is concerned, I would argue that Radcliffe College is actually a much better article than Harvard College right now. The latter is rambling, poorly-organized, and gives too much attention to some things and not enough attention to others; since I know something about the college I feel I really ought to make it a better article — but it's a daunting task. The Radcliffe College article, on the other hand, is direct and to-the-point; it makes the most important points about that college clearly. It is shorter, of course; but that's a separate issue from quality, I would argue. Harvard College has lots of info but is a crummy article; Radcliffe College is brief but well-written and -organized. 

 :Should Radcliffe College be longer? Maybe. But let me point out that Radcliffe College no longer exists; it has been defunct in law since 1999 and in practice since the mid 1970s. It's only natural that living colleges will have more active articles. And, even aside from that, I believe that article quality is as least as important as quantity of information, as long as all the important bases are covered. Don't get me wrong  it's always possible to add interesting new info to articles; and I'm not opposed to the possibility of growth for the Radcliffe College article. I just don't think it's a priority, when so many Wikipedia articles are crummy. 

 :By the way, I presume you know this already; but in case you don't — if you come across a really short article (just a paragraph or two) which isn't already marked as a stub, you can use the {{stub}} tag to do so. But again, like the {{wikify}} tag, we should only use it where truly appropriate.

 Deer Island. 

 Private getaway to the Skull & Bones Society. 

 What do they do there? 

 They raise children for sex and sex alone. 

 When members of Yale's most secret of secret societies go there as a """"getaway,"""" they do not bring their girlfriends. They instead bring small keys [with skull-and-crossbone designs on them, how original] made of various metals [typically gold, sometimes platinum; mixed with stronger substances for strength, of course] taken from the teeth of dead enemies. Mostly fillings, though. 

 What do these keys unlock? 

 Locks to the various underground chambers scattered about the island. There are fifteen tombs of this type [one for each member of this year's chosen bonesmen]. 

 The girls are allowed to grow no older than fourteen years old. 

 They are abused, raped, and taught to like it from birth. They have no nationality, no recognizable country of origin. Typically they're the offspring of gullible [but clean] whores that are brought to Deer Island by clever bonesmen. The whores are killed after the childbirth [and detained on the island during the nine months leading up to it]. 

 At thirteen, the girls are allowed to bear children. Before this age, abortions are routine, one of the island's few year-round residents is an abortionist. He is well paid, and is one of the only non-bonesmen ever allowed to take place in the childsex. 

 Once the thirteen/fourteen year old girls have given birth, they are taken into what are near-exact replicas of the gas chambers at Auschwitz camp I [only crafted from ornate stonework; there are etchings on the walls of various Skull-and-Bones images, the number 322, etc.]. They're told that this will be the site of a celebration of their new child's birth. A futon in the middle of the room is where the child is fucked for the final time, before being choked until unconscious, and gassed [once the bonesman has left the chamber safely, of course]. 

 For having made mention of ANY of this, I could be killed. 

 The girls are given trust tests at age eight, before fellatio can become part of their sexual repertoire. 

 The bonesman will lay his potential cocksucker down on a cold concrete floor in the middle of a well-lit auditorium underground, and force her to lay spread-eagle. He then inserts a straight razor into her VAGINA, vertically, slowly, being careful so as to minimize any potential damage. One flinch from the girl, and the blade is pulled up through the uterus, and the girl is then disposed of [the bonesmen often HOPE for a twitch from the girl, so they can mutilate her with the razor just for fun]. If the child remains calm, the razor is removed, and she is """"rewarded"""" with the privelege of getting to suck the cock of one of the most powerful men in the world. 

 Semen must be swallowed, if fellatio is performed. If the child can't get the bonesman off, he will grab her head, and give a warning thrust, jamming his PENIS into the back of her throat. She is given a couples seconds to recover, and the quality of her blowjob must either improve, or she will get another thrust, harder this time. If a third thrust is necessary, the bonesman does not let go of her head at all, but rams it into his pelvis, until he ejaculates. The girl is often unable to breathe by the end of this, and so, the razor comes out, and the girl is finished off. This very rarely happens though, the girls are taught the proper respect by the time they reach the age of eight. 

 That's all I can share safely tonight; I'll try to post more soon. I need to make it look like I'm here doing research.

142601,"== Vox populi, vox dei == 

 All Wikipedia articles have attached a small questionnaire, at the article bottom: Rate this page: Trustworthy Objective Complete Well-written 

 This article is not trustworthy  nor objective for obviously being written by people who are coming from the RCC clergy or by some deaf and blind Catholics. Equally it is not complete nor well-written. Wikipedia shall make visible and browseable all questionnaires answered and commented, which shall be used to validate this article. My overall number of stars is zero for this version of article. 

 Any attempt to make any positive change is prevented by some who are just dedicated to prevent it. The three of them are bilby, farsight, ricerca (or, maybe, one person with three logins). Ricerca is dedicated to only this article and to only reverts. 

 No matter how long this bad article will be bad, people will be reading other articles like the one here. The most interesting thing are the readers' comments which are overwhelmingly (90%) negative and hostile toward the RCC. What I learned from these comments are: both Popes (Ratzinger and Wojtyla) were Nazi collaborators: Ratzinger ,Hitler's soldier from 1943 to just two months before the Nazi Germany collapse, Wojtyla, an I.G. Farben sales loyal representative whose workplace was just 6 miles from a large concentration camp in Poland. I. G. Farben was supplying zyklon gas to the camp. My earlier knowledge is about Pope Paul VI who signed the Reihchconcordat extension allowing the Vatican to freely spread Catcholicism in Yugoslavia and Russia. 

 I've mentioned this to shed proper light to the alleged persecution of the RCC in Germany. The fact is that paedophilia in Germany is much older than it was thought and putting allegations about paedophilia in Nazi Germany could only shed some positive light on Nazis.  

 Improve: My advice to the Wikipedia RCC followers is to remove Germany, Third Reich 1933-1945 section. Please, do not irritate readers of this article more than necessary. 

 Improve: Introductory shall contain only  

 The Catholic sex abuse cases are a series of ongoing investigations into allegations and convictions for sex crimes committed by Catholic priests and members of religious orders.[1] These cases began receiving public attention beginning in the mid-1980s.[2] There has been criminal prosecutions of the abusers and civil lawsuits against the church's dioceses and parishes. 

 Sexual abuse of minors by priests receives significant media attention in Canada, Ireland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Belgium, France, and Germany, while cases have been reported throughout the world. 

 In addition to cases of abuse, much of the scandal has focused around members of the Catholic hierarchy who did not report abuse allegations to the civil authorities. In many cases they reassigned those accused to other locations where they continued to have contact with minors.[3] 

  

 It shall be added that the targeted victims were coming from the poor, disabled, or were orphans i.e. practically defenceless people. The other part of introductory shall be completely omitted and mentioned in the Vatican and the RCC defense. Popes explanation of the sin nature of this crime shall be not mentioned at all. This crime is at first crime, then sin which is well known and understandable to even the half-brained. 

 Later, I'll rewrite the introductory and see what are the opinions of other users."

 Greetings. Your blanket revert of my edits made no sense on the whole, so I've reinstated most of it. Besides the birthplace niggle, what was wrong with it? If by overlinking you mean the specific world title links in the lead, I cannot see anything wrong with that. Plenty of sportspeople articles (including GAs) do that before the prose, and to a much greater extent. It provides a more informative summary for the reader without having to scroll down to find them in the meat n' bones of the article. Also, """"unsourced nickname""""? I merely removed the italics for it on the field—those are for foreign language nicknames.    
 :You changed the links from the organizations which control the titles to lists of title winners, which was an inappropriate change.  The nature of the titles won is what belonged, not lists of past winners of those.  Additionally, you changed the correct use of imperial measurements for a British fighter to metric units.  Whether MBE belongs in the infobox is up for debate, it is sometimes included, sometimes not.  As it is already prominently linked in the text, I chose to remove it. I did make an error on mentioning the nickname in the edit summary; I did not remove it. I will be restoring the previous - and correct - version of the article.  If you wish to change those links, you will need to take it to the article's talk page per WP:BRD.  """

 == History of Confederate States Army Generals == 
 Ran across a summary that was done in Journal of Mississippi History, August 1977 by Haight and Burns (no not that one!  ).

I thought that nearly everybody was on the field in those days. No remote staff.  

 It claims (slight differences from this article) 8 full generals, 17 lt generals, 72 maj generals and 328 BGs. 125 had been professional soldiers before the war. The largest supply came from former """"lawyers, jurists"""" = 129!

 """"US cities should have climate info from US-based weather sites, not Hong Kong"""". Is this Wikipedia policy? Is this the view of the majority of all other users here? NO. By that argument, many of the cities worldwide that have only World Meteorological Organisation data should have their infoboxes REMOVED; however, this is done because their respective nations' meteorological agencies are at times difficult to navigate. By the same reasoning, the similar data (from WMO) at Miami and San Diego should be REVERTED to NOAA data. Yet no one has objected there. Your logic and reasoning is utter fallacy. HKO runs the WMO site, and its data is directly compiled from national meteorological agencies, in this case NOAA. the HKO data is there because no other source I have found gives daily amount (hours) of sunshine; NOAA at times gives at most percentages, which is MUCH harder to convert into monthly amounts and not optimal for this type of chart.  

 The """"only one source should be used"""" argument is equally bullshit-y. Fine, go untangle what you consider the """"mess"""" that has been created on many US city articles and see how users react. Weather Channel only provides temperature (normals/records) and precipitation (strict totals, not number of days). Your removal of NOAA, an even more reliable source than TWC, constitutes removal of cited information, just due to this pedantic """"only one source"""" reasoning.

 Dear Zoe, 

 First, let me say that I agreed with your request to ban of Aesculapius (I will call him 'Asclape' for spelling ease sake) for 24 hours.  I also posted a notice to that effect on his user talk page to that effect, but he has since erased it.   

 On the other hand, I don't know if you've noticed but Asclape now appears to have no intentions of posting any further posts at Wiki as a result of this.  It is my theory that every editor at Wiki has something valuable to say, the only thing is that they sometimes don't know exactly how to say it.  I try to practice this theory whenever I disagree with another editor, and rather than trying to simply confront them and let them figure everything out for themselves, I try to help them say whatever it is that they are trying to say without violating Wiki policies.  In doing this, I have found that I usually end up by making friends out of potential enemies, rather than the other way around. 

 In following this theory, I have gone ahead and done something that I know is perhaps a bit marginal regarding Wiki policy, and I have taken the link from out of the Parodi article body that lead to Asclape's personal page, and reinserted it in the External links section.  I justify this by the logic that should anyone ever want to research Mr. Michael Parodi himself, that info about his immediate family is usually considered somewhat relevent by such researchers, though in most cases such info usually wouldn't belong in the body of an article.   

 I hope you don't mind me doing this, but I have been watching Asclape's edits for the last month or two, and I have seen him becoming an ever better and better editor, and I think that this is a fair way of addressing some of everyone's concerns. 

 Sincerely,

54067,"""=Terminology=== 

 The term specific intensity is used in the classic works on radiation such as Planck 1914, and many other authoritative physics texts. That was the reason for introducing this article; that reason has nothing to do with computer graphics. The classic authorities actually speak of specific intensity without the qualifier radiative because they are writing in a radiative context. 

 As for seniority, one could ask 'seniority of what?' Seniority of Wikipedia entry or seniority of material? Does the Wikipedia have a policy of authority for seniority of Wikipedia entry? The term specific intensity is over a century old. The term radiance is an update """"improvement"""" promulgated by authority of committees and is the product of committees. 

 Paltridge and PlattPaltridge, G.W., Platt, C.M.R. (1976). Radiative Processes in Meteorology and Climatology, Elsevier, Amsterdam, page 35, a reliable source in its field. comment: """"Even basic quantities such as radiant flux and radiant intensity as used in the general literature are not often the same as the formally endorsed definitions of those terms."""" 

 So far as I understand it, the function of the Wikipedia is to collect and report and make accessible findings from reliable sources, which are many and various in this case. So far as I understand it, it is not to act as a thought-police to enforce exclusive conformity the recommendations of committees, which are only one kind of reliable source, and not to try to regulate diversity of viewpoint, and not to try to enforce conformity to the one and only true and correct and errorless and completely general doctrine and point of view and form of language. 

 According to Born and Wolf Born, M. (1999). Principles of Optics, seventh edition, reprinted 2003, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, page 194, a reliable source in its field. and to HapkeHapke, B. (1993). Theory of Reflectance and Emittance Spectroscopy, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, page 64, also a reliable source in its field., the terms (spectral) brightness and specific intensity and spectral radiance mean the same thing. They refer to a field quantity per unit frequency or wavelength, per unit area, per unit solid angles. They refer to a fileld of non-collimated light. They are different from irradiance and from (light) intensity, which both have the dimension of energy flux density per unit area. Intensity refers to a beam of collimated light. Irradiance refers to non-collimated light immediately originating from a specified surface per unit area of view from a specified direction. 

 The reason for the qualifier specific is to make the term apply to uncollimated non-blackbody radiation as well as to blackbody radiation, and to provide for solid angle. 

 The term (light) intensity by itself is sometimes (Born and Wolf 1999) used to refer to the intensity of a collimated beam. This is also called the irradiance. 

 The specific intensity of a thermal radiative field is non-zero because it is per unit solid angle, while the (integral) flux in any exactly specified direction is infinitesimal and unmeasurable as such. The intensity of a collimated beam is not infinitesimal and is measurable as such, because it is in the exactly specified direction of the beam. 

 Born and Wolf comment: """"It is unfortunate that the same word is used to denote two different quantities."""" 

 The term brightness is currently defined in its Wikipedia article with the source given as the ordinary language dictionary of Webster. A different definition is given in the Oxford English dictionary but is not cited by the Wikipedia article. No opinion is offered by that Wikipedia article as to the relative reliabilities of those two sources. The Wikipedia article on brightness currently does not have much to say about brightness referring to specific radiative intensity, apart from offering opinions about what is """"correct"""" according to the US government. In the latter opinion, it seems from the Wikipedia article that brightness is currently opined as a term of psychophysics, not of the physics of matter. Perhaps someone will feel like remedying this. 

 As for specificity for light, the terms discussed in the present articles in general refer to all wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, not just to the visible wavelengths. Some authors regard the term light as referring to all wavelengths, not only to the visible.

141200,"== SYS Linux Distribution == 

 The SYS distro exists already some years, without big changes (besides of updates).  All Linuxdistros have their short wiki page.  Like on them, on the page for SYS was tried to explain within an article of 1-2 print pages, the most important characteristics of the distro - specially what distinguishes this distro from other distros in a positive sense, as required from the wiki politics and discused with or even suggested by earlier reviewers of the wiki page. 

 Thus, to my opinion, it shouldn't changed too much, and not removed important characteristics. 

  
 Last time, was removed f.ex. these characteristics: 

 1) * Fully-automated installation; 10–30 minutes typically, quick and simple for new users. 

 2) * Reliable, fast mirrors. 

 3) * A non-commercial , free distro, independent of commercial or other short-term politics 

  
 An important source is the program's project page at Softpedia and at Linuxquestions.org  .  There are given extended informations.   They were readed by thousands of persons, and also made thousands of downloads (see p.ex. the download counter at softpedia), and when there would be wrong descriptions about the distro, then users would have left a comment / reclamation or bad votation. 

 The wiki page contains only a very compacted explanation of these details. 

  
 To 1: It's one of the most important characteristics and origin of the SYS distro, for make it most easy for beginners, that the installation is full AUTOMATICALLY.   This is short explained, with a few words (and this proportionally / reasonably short) in the wiki page, and more detailed in the sources just explained.  How I could explain this important and unique characteristics of the distro more short ????    Also, interested people can simply try it out, download the install .iso from the quoted mirrors  and install it from a DVD or USB key. 

 To 3: There are some comercial and many no-comercial distros, so that in the wiki page, according to the wiki guides how to obtain it, it's given the information that it's gratis (and downloadable from the mirrors).    Also - what's important for the reliability over long time - is given theinformation that SYS will not dependon short-term profit orprofit-deception.    Also this is more detailed explained in the quoted sources. And can be verified imediately, clicking the link to themirrors, where everything is gratis downloadable and notpresent any comercial or limited version. 

 To 2: The most important mirrors are given in he wikipage itself. One can see directly, that this are mirrors kept at university institutes, which keep a certain standard and (at least some of them) check out the distros stocked there.   This is an opposite to distros which are stocked only on 1 or 2 mirrors (like, f.ex: paldo, goblinx -which seems to have no working mirror anymore, and many other distros).   There were even canceled some SYS mirrors which stopped to work good.  

  
 To my opinion, can be improved the english of the article, but I think the contens is already so short that almost nothing can be make shorter without to miss any 'minimum contens' rule of wiki for linux distros.   It should be observed that similar informations give also the other distros. 

 Also should be observed, that SYS is not one of these minimum distros; in opposite it's a big distro with many thousands of own packages (and probeably one of the fastest to compile and provide new linux kernel .tgz packages  whilst a big part of other distros nor provide own kernel packages at all, but take them from others like Debian, RedHat etc).   Also, SYS brings already appr. 18 GB programs (lzma-highly-compacted) on the install DVD what installs this huge system between 10 to 40 min. Therefore, I think the wiki page is reasonable short about all relevantaspects of the distro. 

 There is a 'war' between distrowatch anda very few numbers of other info pages, which don't want to report about SYS. In revange, in SYS in /etc/host are blocked these web pages, and the user is conducted to SYS-friendly concurrence of them.  Also, for users in France, the installation stops, because of the open-source-enemy french law (shall theyspend their money to M$ !!).  This are also special characteristis mentioned only very abreviated in the SYS wiki page.

133391,":Dear RifThanks for the comments; I had already anticipated the need for pre-Nineteenth century gunboats (and, as you say, gunbrigs), and I know how I'll get them in there very easily.  Can you send me the details in the same way?  I'll take a couple of weeks at least to run through the current gunboats/gunvessels page, ensuring that the details are error-free (which I doubt, given my errors of transcription that I've already uncovered).  It also occurs to me that torpedo-boats are not listed anywhere - I imagine another (but much shorter list) is called for.  As for the format, it has the very strong advantage of making the class pages simple to write - as I'm doing with Mariner class gunvessels.  What I could do is simply delete the lists as the class pages get filled in.   One question I do have for you is: have I missed any entire classes out, and do all the vessel listed count as Royal Navy vessels?  I'm thinking particularly of Magnet, Canada and the like.  I've left out all the colonial service vessels (but not HMS Diana (1823)) for that very reason.Thanks for all your help - without it, I wouldn't so much have started.Yours,"

128506,":This has come up several times in the past. This is the background to how it was raised. Bit bored by the topic now and desperately want to focus my wiki time on page creation (see List of Anglo-Saxon saints), but basically there is a tension between the forms you might expect from a superficial reading of UE guidelines, and those used by the reliable sources. Typically those who write articles in the era prefer the latter, while those brought in from process talk pages (like UE) prefer the former. No consensus on the matter has ever come about. Article titles are one thing. Different display titles are useful in different contexts. In monarch lists and more popular pages the anglicized names can be used without much difficulty; however using them in articles like this means departing from the forms used the in WP:RSs used to construct the article (as I can attest as the author) and creating serious issues of cognitive dissonance; compare this to using Gdansk in some eras but Danzig in others. We happened to have modern Anglicized names for Mael Coluim and a few famous kings, but most of the Scottish names used are ones like Garnait, Gille Chlerig and so where there is either no Anglicization or where it is so obscure as to be unhelpful. One of the routine experiences of reading about foreign societies in the distant past are unfamiliar name forms. One masters these and grows (and in any case, only a small minority of these names can ever be anglicized), and in any case I don't seriously believe the claim that 'general reader' will actually be confused. Even GoodDay was able to identify who Mael Coluim IV was.  ()"

It is interesting to note, that some gasses are *less* narcotic than air (apparently). Building a table of the exact narcotic effect at any pressure would probably end up a phase diagram for every gas.

The view on whether at this stage it is too soon to create an article on a film currently at pre-production stage is a subjective one; subjective arguments, derived from personal opinions like the one you have expressed, do not constitute official guidelines or policies unless stated otherwise (e.g. an official guideline stating and clearly informing at what stage of creation any films/projects/books, etc  can be added; such official guideline does not exist). As such, I cannot counteract that particular view with a factual and objective statement. Conversely, the argument presented by you should be presented not as a clearly set guideline and final reality, as it was, but rather as for what it actually is: a personal perspective on a specific matter.  

 If the article is to be nominated for deletion, at the very least, the actual reasons behind it should be made clear and transparent and not camouflaged as something else seemingly more objective. On a last note, when communicating matters such as these, or any matters whatsoever, sarcasm and belittling comments are inappropriate and have no place when expressing rational and civilized views. This is an universal guideline, whether we are in the context of online communications, face-to-face or of any kind. I am presuming that one of the main reasons for patrolling and contributing to Wikipedia in the manner you have chosen is to combat inappropriate language or usage, as much as it is to ensure quality of content and a project / community to be proud of.

 The organization of this [talk] page is confusing, with older talk randomly interspersed (restored?) in the midst of late June 2005 talk. Anyway, it's 234 kilobytes long and way overdue for an archive. I started archiving but got overtaken.

POM conducted the most recent one.  I would like to hear what Rikurzen and Ultramarine think about this, as they are most responsible for the article and are most affected by what is chosen to be done.   
 ::You're talking about the reorganization of the talk page, not the article, right? I have little idea what's going on with the talk page, but there's only a few active threads about article content (Arbor's work on references, and the Proposal 1 work, which may be finished).

 == Article Rewrite == 

 So what can be improved? First off, I still have doubts on that table - I'm still persuaded that the data within is rather apples to oranges, or in any case, certainly not based on anything that can be called a """"metropolitan area"""". The Tokyo and Osaka """"県"""" is certainly not this and, again, there is no Paris AU GDP. Isn't there a similar study somewhere that can be sourced directly? 

 As for the comparisons... I would agree that, as they are, these seem trumpeting simply because they have no context. Comparisons are useful in describing national/international market evolution (eg. the Paris region WWI - WWII machine and motor industry and its role in the European economy/production, now moving to services), but """"bigger than that country"""" is pointless - especially when the reader doesn't have a clue about the economy of the compared-to country. 

 If anything, this article should be rewritten in using terms and regions used by the economists of its own country - this is the only way it can be verifiable. Any """"bending"""" of names and figures to the goal of international comparison, unless it is a direct citation of a respectable reference doing the same, smacks of original research. In short, this article should place the numbers where they are, and not be an exercise bent to a """"greater schema"""" of international comparison. 

 How do English references speak of the Paris Economy? There should be the guideline, methinks, as it bypasses all """"international understanding"""" arguments forwarded thus far. I have the 2006 Britannica - Time for a gander.  """

 I knew that after leaving a very successful professional football career, Fran Tarkenton set himself up as a businessman and led seminars for other businessmen.  Little did I know that one day I would receive an email from him.  How did he know my email address?  What could a legendary football hero have to say to me?  How can I help Fran Tarkenton? 

 So I hurriedly and expectantly opened the email from this legend of a quarterback and found, to my dismay, typical spam offering me an opportunity to purchase a report that will reveal the hidden information behind seminars.  This was not legendary football hero kind of spam; just your everyday, normal, annoying spam sent by a spambot to millions of unwitting email addresses stored on a CD and purchased from a greasy looking fellow in a back alley.   

 Thank YOU, Fran Tarkenton, for getting my hopes up and knocking them right back down like a linebacker who was just informed of indiscreet sexual relations between his mother and the opposing team's punter.   

 Thank YOU, Fran Tarkenton, for the offer to buy some truth from you.  The world needs less hype and more truth, although the world could do without any more spammers. 

 Thank YOU, Fran Tarkenton, for helping me differentiate between the hype and truth about Fran Tarkenton.  The hype is that you are a legend; the truth is that you are an annoying spammer."

 ::I count 10 references to the question of a formal marriage in the one paragraph.  I might revise as follows (sorry  I don't know how to do strikeouts, or I would use them, for the ease of comprehension of my proposed changes): 
 ::. . . Fuller and Ossoli moved in together in Florence, Italy.  At least originally, Fuller balked at marrying, in part because of their different religions; she was Protestant and he was Roman Catholic.  Emerson speculated that the couple was """"married perhaps in Oct. Nov. or Dec"""" of 1847, though he did not explain his reasoning.  Biographers have speculated that the couple married on April 4, 1848, to celebrate the anniversary of their first meeting.  [Note from me:  Having been acquainted for a year seems a weird and flimsy basis for speculating that a couple got married, and unless this is elucidated, I would delete the sentence.]  By the time the couple moved to Florence, they were referred to as husband and wife, though it seems certain that at the time their child was born, they were not married. [Note from me:  Why does it seem certain?  Without an explanation, it's confusing, and I would take out the last part of that sentence.]  By New Year's Day 1848, Fuller suspected that she was pregnant but kept it from Ossoli for several weeks.  Their child, Angelo Eugene Philip Ossoli, was born in early September 1848; they nicknamed him Angelino. The couple was very secretive about their relationship but, after Angelino suffered an unnamed illness, they became closer.  [Note from me:  Why does being secretive about their relationship relate in a contradictory way (""""but"""") to their becoming closer?]  Fuller finally informed her mother about Ossoli and Angelino in August 1849. The letter explained that she had kept silent so as not to upset her, """"but it has become necessary, on account of the child, for us to live publicly and permanently together.""""  Her mother's response makes it clear that she was aware that a legal marriage had not taken place.  [Note from me:  If the mother was """"aware,"""" that tells me that the question of a marriage was resolved.  If it was not resolved, the sentence should read, """"makes it clear that she understood that a legal marriage had not taken place.]  Even so, she was happy for her daughter, writing: """"I send my first kiss with my fervent blessing to my grandson.""""  Modern biographers are still unclear if Fuller and Ossoli ever married.  [Note from me:  This last sentence seems superfluous; even after my suggested deletions, it's clear from the preceding text.] 
 ::Thanks, Midnightdreary, for working with me on this.  I look forward to seeing what you think.   """
6895,"""::You're both questioning whether my summary of the momentum theorem is correct and uses the term correctly, and whether it is fully supported.  First, let's look at the apparent contradiction between me and Emanuel, as raised by  

 :::""""Emanuel describes the force as acting within the control volume, McLean as acting at its boundary."""" 

 ::There's actually no contradiction here.  Note that Emanuel defines the RHS of eq 14.1 as """"the vector sum of the applied forces that act on the system, which here is the fluid inside V.""""  The force acting on the boundary (the second integral on the RHS) is part of that sum, along with the body force acting throughout the interior.  So Emanuel considers the force acting at the boundary to be part of the total force acting """"on the fluid inside V"""".  Then if you neglect gravity, the first integral on the RHS (the volume integral) is zero, and  only the second integral (the force acting at the boundary) remains.  So my description is identical to his when gravity is neglected. 

 ::True, Emanuel doesn't say that gravity can be neglected, and neither does Shapiro's section 1.5, but gravity is neglected in every application of the momentum theorem to aerodynamics that I've ever seen, including the ones I cite in the article.  Clancy's firehose analysis also neglects gravity.  And in the rest of Shapiro's book, when he uses Newton's second law, he leaves the gravity force out without explaining why.  So does every other aerodynamics book on my shelf, except Batchelor.  On p. 176, in a section headed """"Modification of the pressure to allow for the effect of the body force"""", Batchelor shows that gravity does not affect the dynamics of a constant-density flow because the body force (the weight of a fluid parcel) is canceled by a background gravitational-hydrostatic pressure gradient that always accompanies it.  Thus neglecting both the body-force term and the gravitational-hydrostatic part of the pressure gradient is rigorously justified for constant-density flow. 

 ::So neglecting the effect of gravity on the flow is something everyone does in aerodynamics applications, and most take it for granted.  In my quick check of the sources, Batchelor is the only one who takes the time to justify it rigorously.  Neither Shapiro nor Emanuel mentions the simplified form of the momentum theorem with the gravity terms omitted, so I see now that it's misleading for me to cite them when I state the simplified form.  I'll propose a fix for this problem below. 

 ::Now to the matter of steady flow.   wrote: 

 :::""""I don't see anything in Shapiro 1.5 which says that the first RHS term of Eq 1.15 is zero in steady flow"""". 

 ::True, he doesn't say it in 1.5.  He defines steady flow in 1.2 as """"a condition where at each point in space there is no variation of any property with respect to time"""", and writes it as the partial derivative of any property with respect to time equals zero, using density as an example.  So I'd say that Eq 1.15 with the first RHS term set to zero for the case of steady flow is fully supported by Shapiro. 

 ::On this same topic  also wrote: 

 :::""""If I was mistaken to say, 'The idea that either of the relationships derived above for steady flow conditions are """"The momentum theorem"""" is not consistent with any of the sources I have seen', I ask   to specify where the evidence is."""" 

 ::I said that I didn't understand your basis for saying this because it seemed to me at the time, and it still does, that your relationship ∑F = ∮c.s. is identical to Shapiro's eq 1.15, for the case of steady flow, and is thus consistent with Shapiro.  This version of the equation requires only steady flow; it doesn't require neglecting gravity.  So I think that in addition to being consistent with Shapiro, it is fully supported, though as I point out above, you have to look in section 1.2 in addition to 1.5.  The short answer to your question is that the evidence regarding the unsteady flow term is in Shapiro.   

 ::Whether it is correct to refer to it as """"the momentum theorem"""" is the next question.   wrote: 

 :::""""There is also the question of whether it is correct to refer to a degenerate case of Shapiro's eq 1.15, with the first RHS term set to zero for steady flow, as """"the momentum theorem"""". By way of comparison, if one described a relationship derived from Newton's second law where F = 0, it would look very much like Newton's first law.""""

 Understanding Concepts 
 1. pressure or volume, conductivity, absorbency of light 
 2. concentration, temperature, catalysis, chemical nature of reactants 
 3. Additional surface area = 18 � 1 cm2 
 Total surface area = 24 cm2 
 Proportional change in surface area = � 
 26/4cm2� = 4 
 The rate would be multiplied by a factor proportional to the surface area change: 
 r = 4 � 20 mL/s 
 r = 80 mL/s 
 4. (a) rate increases 
 (b) rate decreases 
 (c) rate increases 
 (d) rate increases 
 5. (a) r = � 
 r = 1.47 mL/s 
 (b) (i) With a 5ºC increase in temperature, the rate could be doubled and the time halved. 
 (ii) Without the catalyst, the reaction might be imperceptibly slow. 
 6. (a) r = k [ClO2(aq)]2[OH– 
 (aq)] 
 (b) This is a third-order reaction. 
 (c) The rate would quadruple. 
 (d) The rate would double. 
 7. (a) When we compare Trials 1 and 2, we see that as [Cl2] is doubled, rate is multiplied by 2; therefore, rate depends 
 on [Cl2]1. 
 When we compare Trials 2 and 3, we see that as [NO] is doubled, rate is multiplied by 4; therefore, rate depends 
 on [NO]2. 
 Overall, r = k [Cl2]1[NO]2.

 11. (a) There are generally one, two, or three particles involved in each elementary step. 
 (b) Collisions of more particles at the same point in time and space are much less probable as the number of particles 
 increases. Four-body collisions are effectively impossible as contributors to a reaction process. 
 12. (a) A catalyst might be consumed in one step of a mechanism as long as it is regenerated in a subsequent step. 
 (b) Homogeneous catalysts, like acid in aqueous solution, are in the same phase as reactants. Heterogeneous catalysts, 
 like platinum in gases, are in different phases from reactants.

 (c) Since the I– 
 (aq) is not part of the rate-determining (slow) step, increasing its concentration will have no effect on 
 the overall rate. 
 (d) Since the S2O8 
 2– 
 (aq) is part of the rate-determining (slow) step, increasing its concentration will increase the overall 
 rate. 

 15. (a) When we compare Trials 1 and 2, we see that as [W] is doubled, rate is unchanged; therefore, rate depends on [W]0. 
 When we compare Trials 1 and 3, we see that as [X] is doubled, rate is multiplied by 2; therefore, rate depends 
 on [X]1. 
 When we compare Trials 1 and 4, we see that as [Y] is doubled, rate is multiplied by 4; therefore, rate depends 
 on [Y]2. 
 Overall, r = k [X]1 [Y]2. 
 (b) The rate-determining step is X + 2Y → products. 
 (c) A possible mechanism might be: 
 X + 2Y → XY2 (slow) 
 XY2 + W → WXY2 (fast) 
 WXY2 + X → Z (fast) 

 16. (a) When we compare Trials 1 and 2, we see that as [Hbn] is doubled, rate is multiplied by 2; therefore, rate depends 
 on [Hbn]1. 
 When we compare Trials 2 and 3, we see that as [CO] is tripled, rate is multiplied by 3; therefore, rate depends 
 on [CO]1. 
 (b) The overall order is two. 
 (c) Overall, r = k [Hbn]1 [CO]1. 
 (d) The carbon monoxide rate constant might be expected to be larger than the oxygen rate constant because it seems to 
 bind so quickly to hemoglobin. On the other hand, as will be discovered in the next unit, the more significant factor 
 is the equilibrium constant for the binding reaction, which is much larger for carbon monoxide than for oxygen."

 == After Alinsky: Community Organizing in Illinois == 
 The Woods Charitable Fund (how one foundation came to support community organizing) sponsored a series of 9 articles about community organizing in Illinois that were published between January 1988 and July 1989 in the monthly public affairs magazine Illinois Issues. 
 One of the 9 articles in the series, """"Why organize? Problems and promise in the inner city"""" by Barack Obama appeared in the August-September 1988 issue of Illinois Issues, pp. 40–42. 
 Obama's article """"Why organize? Problems and promise in the inner city"""" did not mention Alinsky. 
 The 9 articles in the series were reprinted in a book edited by Illinois Issues associate editor Peg Knoepfle, After Alinksy: Community Organizing in Illinois, published in June 1990 with a grant from the Woods Charitable Fund. 
 The book also included 30 pages of excerpts from a September 22, 1989 roundtable discussion with 8 of the 9 authors of the reprinted articles and several other participants, and 25 pages of excerpts from a July 15, 1989 interview of Tom Gaudette by Peg Knoepfle. 

 """"Organizing in the 1990s. Excerpts from a Roundtable Discussion"""" (pp. 123-152) in: Knoepfle, Peg (ed.) (1990). After Alinksy: Community Organizing in Illinois. Springfield, Ill.: Sangamon State University ISBN 0-9620873-3-5p. 124:On September 22, 1989, the authors of the articles that make up most of this book got together in Chicago with representatives from Illinois Issues, Woods Charitable Fund, Inc., and other guests for an afternoon discussion.John Kretzmann, trustee of the Wieboldt Foundation and director of the Urban Studies Program for the Associated Colleges of the Midwest served as moderator.Authors taking part in the discussion were . . . Barack Obama, """"Why Organize?""""; . . .Also participating were J. Michael Lennon, publisher of Illinois Issues; Sokoni Karanja, trustee of the Woods Charitable Fund, Inc. and executive director of Centers for New Horizons; Anne Hallett, director of the Wieboldt Foundation; Louis Delgado, assistant director of the special grants program at the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. Other guests from Woods were Lucia Woods Lindley, trustee and photographer, and program directors Ken Rolling and Daryl Woods. Also present was Peg Knoepfle, associate editor of Illinois Issues. Court reporter Wanda Monterrubio recorded the discussion.pp. 132-133:Obama: . . . . Part of the main function of my article, and the main function of this book and this conversation is to try to place organizing in a larger context, to figure out what kind of animal it is. I remember talking to Peter Martinez [a Chicago organizer, trained by Alinksy] awhile back. And he said something that I think to some extent I share a view with. He said, """"I care about organizing. I don't care about community organizing."""" And I think what he meant by that is that organizing has a long tradition in this country. It didn't start with Alinksy. It didn't stop with Alinksy. What it has to do with is: How do you include the excluded in this country? And its history started with the founding fathers. It goes on to the abolitionists. It includes people who organize machine politics in Chicago, people who organize the black church in the South. How do you get people who are on the outside of the mainstream into the mainstream. And also, how do you get that mainstream to change through that process, to get rich and examine itself and remake itself? That's the important question. And I think what Saul Alinksy came up with was one cut on that.

That is exactly what the policy say's here to do. How am I suppose to follow a policy only to find myself blocked for following it? Adam Carr freely admits he posted the email on-wiki in the RfC I had started on him. I even asked the original blocking admin for the proof that I made any legal comments on wiki and not once have I gotten a answer on it. I still ask for it and I am still ignored. Everything that has happened after all this went on is a direct result of the dumb-ass admin here that blocked me in the first place for following the fucking policy to direct any legal issues in email and off-wiki. For so many users and admin here not one person has stepped up to realize that my original block was wrong and should have been removed. That just shows either all the admin here are brainless and spineless to see that Adam was just being a WP:DICK or they are truely scared of Jimbo and his mighty crew of storm troopers that run Wikipedia the way they want to as long as King Jimbo lets them. When will the admin start following the real policy and not make them up as they go or choose when, where and on who they enforce them?

78625,"Hi Kaldari, 
 I understand. 
 To answer your first question, No. I am not currently being paid to edit any article. 
 I understand the concerns so I'll just go over my contribution history. 
 *Mark Portmann: Created 2 years ago from youthful exuberance. 
 *Babtunde Rotimi: I haven't contacted him, but being a winner of a writing award myself, I was interested in the news article and turned to Wikipedia for information on him. When I found that there was none. I decided to create a page. 
 *EmbroidMe. Paid to create the page which I submitted through the AFC to ensure that it fit Wiki's guidelines. 
 *Gailen David. Like Babtunde, I was interested in the subject because I'd seen a couple of his mock videos. 
 *UassistMe. Contacted by the party that offered me the EmbroidMe project to see if I could help with the page's creation. I submitted it to the AFC, it was turned down, so I politely informed the party that the project was a bust. 
 *Mariana Bierkna. It was listed in Wiki Commons as an article for request that was dated by over a year. Started work on it with help from members of the IRC who sent across PDF files and access to a librarian.  
 *IonRoad: My latest attempt to create a page that was worthy of at least a C class. I chose the subject because it seemed well covered and clearly within the notability requirements of Wikipedia. 

 I did some work for the owner of PhotographyTalk but after I was warned that my efforts amounted to spam, I abandoned the project and was not paid. I believe he hired someone else after that. Before I was hired to work on the UassistMe and EmbroidMe project, I was made to sign an NDA. Considering that this is an open forum, I'm hoping these disclosures will be deleted. 
 I've also been approached at least four times by external parties who wanted to have their articles included in Wikipedia. But after reviewing their companies, I informed them that they did not meet the requirements of Wikipedia.  

 I believe this answers 2 out of Seraphims questions, as to the last 'why have you created so many articles which appear to be promotional and what plans do you have to be remedy it', my only defence is that I did not know that the articles appeared promotional because multiple editors in the IRC channel assured me that they weren't when I requested a review. 
 Regarding my plans of addressing this problem, I believe my proposed probational terms, combined with those suggested by Kaldari and Nick gives me more than enough time to hone my editorial skills. 

 Regards"

See there can be other meanings to Great Power rather than one mentioned in the article (even though I cannot debate on them). As far as the Political Influence goes I feel that India has always been a soft state. About the military, I guess the only reason we have a force as large as we have because of the hostility with the neighbors, otherwise the things would have been different. And we have never been known as great sports persons or athletes. However these factors should not overshadow the fact the India's mildness and tolerance are a great virtue, it has been a country of saints and we should not be surprised that nature is found in the overall behavior and  attitude of the country. See somehow we need to acknowledge that keeping in mind the negative points, the positives are way too heavy. Like the list goes on and on. One of the few countries in the world that can make their own cars, launch their satellites, have nuclear power, are the largest (or in the top league) producers, manufacturers and exporters of innumerable items, are among the fastest growing economies, among the largest already, biggest democracy, multi lingual, multi religious etc..the only country that can be termed equal or even greater than India is US, not even China due to the politics and intolerance over their.

""""H.A.T.E.U"""" is probably one of these. It was released around the time of my worst break-up (I know: TMI), and the song brought me through a lot. And it's been a favorite of mine ever since. Emancipation of Mimi is my all-time favorite album, with """"Stay the Night"""" being the best track. But I don't like """"Through the Rain""""- I like only the climax. I was never a fan of her breathy vocals, and esp on the second chorus where she sang the last word of every line in falsetto (listen to it!), it just annoyed the hell out of me.  
 :::::And I'll tell you why Adele is such an amazing singer. There are those technically proficient singers who give me goosebumps with how high they can sing, or how strong their voice is. But in cases like these, I'm not in awe of the song, I'm in awe of the notes the singer hits. For Adele, when she sings, you don't hear the high notes- you hear the pain and conviction in every word she sings. That's the difference between having a good voice, and being a good singer. Adele is the latter. Adele+Amy Winehouse= greatness.

 == What Is the Yahoo! Widget Engine? == 

 The Yahoo! Widget Engine (formerly known as Konfabulator) is a JavaScript runtime engine for Windows and Mac OS X that lets you run little files called Widgets that can do pretty much whatever you want them to. Widgets can be alarm clocks, calculators, can tell you your WiFi signal strength, will fetch the latest stock quotes for your preferred symbols, and even give your current local weather.  

 What sets Yahoo! Widget Engine apart from other scripting applications is that it takes full advantage of today's advanced graphics. This allows Widgets to blend fluidly into your desktop without the constraints of traditional window borders. Toss in some sliding and fading, and these little guys are right at home in Windows XP and Mac OS X.  

 The format for these Widgets is completely open and easy to learn so creating your own Widgets is an extremely easy task.  

 For the """"skinning"""" crowd, Yahoo! Widget Engine is a dream come true. You can easily change the look, feel, layout, even functionality of a Widget so that it matches your lifestyle, your desktop, or the pants or skirt you have on that day. 

 A Little History... 
 Some time in early 2000 Arlo Rose came up with an idea for a cool little application. It would use XML to structure images, and a scriptable language, like Perl, in such a way that someone who knew the basics of Perl could put together cool little mini-applications. The goal was that these mini-applications would just sit around on your desktop looking pretty, while providing useful feedback. 

 All he ever really wanted was to have a cool looking battery monitor and something that told him the weather, but he knew the possibilities for something like this could potentially be limitless. 

 Fast forward a couple of years when Arlo began working with Perry Clarke at Sun Microsystems. Over lunch one afternoon Arlo gave Perry the basics of this dream app. Perry suggested that JavaScript would be far easier for people to digest. He was right. It's the basis for Flash's ActionScript, and Adobe's scripting engine for Photoshop. Of all the choices, JavaScript made the most sense. Shortly after that lunch, the two began to spend their nights and weekends making this thing a reality. 

 A half year later it was ready for download on Mac OS X. 

 Time flew by, Ed Voas joined the team and the Windows version was unveiled.

 == Flanders & Swan citation edit == 

 Hi Robert 

 The problem I have is that there isn't by definition going to be a published source for this - the tape can be found in the BBC's own VT catlog (which used to be known as VTOL but now goes by a different acronym.) The problem is that this is closed system only accessible to BBC staff. So I suppose that if you really wanted to push the point my """"source"""" is a print out from VTOL which I still have in my files somewhere. The thing is without someone comming round to my house and looking at it or going to the BBC library and doing their own print out that isn't really a """"publication"""". 

 The fact that I worked at the BBC is easily verified however... because you only have to go to the www.vtoldboys.com - and look up my name in the """"credits"""" section where you will find it recorded that I was there from 1989 to 1997 and that I now work at TSWFTA in plymouth. (www.tswfta.co.uk) when you can see a picture of me working a Telecine machine. 

 Notwithstanding the lack of previous publication I feel that the information IS important as for many years the accepted wisdom has been that no copy survives of this recording. Since 1994 (when I found the film) I have known this to be incorrect (as do various other Ex and current BBC employees) but until now have lacked the means to communicate it. 

 I don't know where that leaves us... I am very new to this wikipedia world... and I have no wish to upset anyone... but for all the reasons stated i do feel that this information is important and shouldn't be arbitarily deleted simply because it is a previously unpublished fact. If we adopt that approach then surely no one will ever be able to add anything new?

 == ANI on Alan Liefting == 

 A bit late (and pointless) to insert this into the ongoing ANI discussion, but you stated there """"I have yet to see an explanation why colon-isation or commenting out is a better method than outright removal."""" You may not be convinced by the explanations, but they were given a long time ago, at the start of the discussion (e.g. """"Actually, you do waste it. Perhaps not yours, but the wikitime of other people. Reactivating categories is much easier and faster than having to go through the history to find a version pre your edits and get the cats from there. Fram (talk) """" and """"AfC pages are supposed to have the categories indicated [...] — Arthur Rubin (talk) """" and """"This makes it much easier for the people creating articles in userspace to move the pages to the mainspace and to check that the categories they want to use actually exist, while still having the wanted benefit of removing non-mainspace pages from mainspace categories. Fram (talk) """")    

 :And it makes them ugly - The edit is clearly indicated, it is a matter of undo and voila, the categories are back.  HotCat does a good job as well.  It does not make any difference - I am sorry, you still did not convince me.  And that for 12 pages for which 30% (overall) does not get into mainspace anyway, so at best 4 of these would need to have the categories back.      
 :Adding to it, some were in userspace, not in AfC space, and some were failed AfC's anyway.  This is just like the case of the sock categories - you make a lot of noise about it, and half of it goes already away by properly looking at it and tagging them properly, another set is just minor as well (the user is tagged on their userpage or, even worse, usertalkpage, so they are well aware that they are suspected or known sockpuppets; or they are aware even of SPI's on them), another set would just find SPI's anyway, so there is nothing extra if you find the categories as well, and then still, most of those editors will never look for it.  And the same is where you command Alan to stop doing something that has already been done for 80%, but because you don't like the way it is done, you command him to stop (the request that you want a better edit summary is reasonable, but it is utterly unreasonable that you request him to stop when he has a good, but not optimal edit summary) - moreover, that results in the second thread about Alan on AN/I where it is blatantly clear that the edits should be done - and have been done for over 80% before.  And so was this.  I am sorry, Fram, but your actions have resulted in a handful of editors walking aweay (if even temporarily), and other being put aside by ArbCom.  And these three examples here just show what futility you have been using against it.  You have in all three cases a point, but your reaction to it is .. way over the top.      
 :Oh, and in case you are thinking to respond - please explain why if you are asked to stop editing (the categorisations) because some editors do not agree with the categorisation scheme, that you can continue (and are still continuing to do that), even though you can not show any other form of consensus for the scheme than 'common practice' (and actually, an RfC is partially condemning what is being done), or why AGK, the arbitrator who protected 7,500 templates at speeds over 100 edits per minute, when he is asked to stop, that he can just continue (note that consensus and policy were against the actions performed by AGK).  But when you ask Alan to stop, he has to stop (even if it influences until then only 4-5 pages) - and he needs to show consensus.  Yes, because it is you, Fram.  And that is what is happening here on Wikipedia - and that is why many long-established, 100k+ editors are walking away or refusing to improve Wikipedia, where those editors don't even wait for you, they just put away their bots and don't operate them anymore.

 == Dominated by nationalists == 

 So why couldn't anyone answer Interestedinfairness's question? What is wrong with using Noel Malcolm? He is a highly regarded neutral writer with only Serbs having no respect for him (can't think why?? um???) and he rightly says in his books that serbs have so overplayed the whole Kosova claim that it is not his fault that there are so many myths about the place rightfully being theirs. Kosova - and that is it's name, is a country not a territory, not a disputed region and certainly not no """"Resolution 1244 part of Serbia under UN"""". It was this until 2008, and then it declared independence. That independence was followed by recognition from the USA, from the UK, from France and from all other respectable democracies. If anyone wants to go slagging off illegal countries, I'll give you all two: South Ossetia and Abkazia, they are leggaly parts of Georgia. But leave Kosova alone, and for the last time  -""""Kosova"""" is the country's name. It is not governed by the Serbs any more. Socalled """"Kosovo"""" was a name devized by Slobodan Milosevic to distinguish it from it's true Albania character. For those of you who don't know history, Milosevic went to Kosova when it was still Yugoslavia and had his infamous Martin Luther King style speech """"I have a dream"""", which in his case was """"I have a dream - of Greater Serbia"""", and within a short time, he cancelled Kosova's autonomy and government, moved in his Serbs and sent in his Serb army to invade the land and cleanse it of non-Serbs. And this is not the voice of Interestedinfairness, this is not the voice of Metrospex, this is not even me speaking, this is REUTERS and it is also BBC, SKY, CNN and other impartial neutral news networks. As Interestedinfairness said, this land cannot be disputed - Reuters themselves call it a country. Since noone has answered back to the neutral/fair points made by Metrospex and Interestedinfairness, I now conclude that the """"pro-serb"""" arguments have run out and they have lost yet anothe rone of their wars. So as a neutral editor myself with no interest in Serbo-Albanian affairs, I can safely say that """"Kosova is a country"""" and that the Guardian article aswell as all other works by the respected Noel Malcolm can be taken as fact.    
 :this, """"Mr.Neutral"""",  is exactly why: the dishonesty. We are trying to write an encyclopedia and we should not be expected to play hide-and-seek with people who do not even have the respect and good faith to forego the fundamentally puerile option of sockpuppetry.

""""A tract or expanse of land of undefined extent; a region, district"""" and 2. """"A tract or district having more or less definite limits in relation to human occupation"""", and only 3. """"The territory or land of a nation"""". The patriots try to impose usage in sense 3., which is obviously the subject matter of the international dispute.

This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article. 

 If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

I hope they don't."""" This comment had the effect of producing a widespread exodus from the ashrams that year, which gave rise to an individualistic attitude. This was reflected in Alan's outlook at the close of 1976. """"Everyone is beginning to see that Divine Light Mission is just a bunch of people trying to meditate and love each other. All the holier-than-thou bullshit is crumbling. I don't have to wait for Guru Maharaj Ji to communicate through all the layers of leadership to me in order to learn what I need to know.

 Preface 

 """"Ashram creates itself so holy an environment that when a car passes right there in front of an ashram, the driver feels some strange feeling in his tires. Something so holy, something so attractive, something so elegant, because in this world, we can walk in the streets and we can see the lights and when you drive at night, you might feel a strange reaction because of all these lights there. But in the ashram, no lights, but internal light's still glowing. Everyone is completely amazed when he sees the light coming through, because when people meditate, there is clearly light coming out of them. 

 """"And when man does meditation, then it really comes out of him, he becomes a part of the meditation, like if you go to a tub and there is white paint in it, and you go down in the tub and come out, then you'll be all white, because that white color has touched you and become a part of you. So, when we stick to something, when we stick to Knowledge, we become a part of Knowledge. 

 """"And what is Knowledge? Knowledge is light. And we have to become light and everyone wants to become light. He glows, but not for himself he glows, he glows for everyone. If I'm a man, and I have got a torch and there are a hundred people following me, they can all see clearly, because if only one man has a torch, a hundred people can see. So when you glow, you don't show direction to yourself, but you show how to be, how to be. 

 """"Now you see, God is the controller, it is His control trip. Why do you only see with your eyes, why not with your mouth or with your nose? Why only with your eyes? You talk about it being a control trip, then why do you only see with your eyes and not with your mouth? Why? Because that's the way things are, and that's the way things are going to be, understand? A man who sees through his mouth, you're not going to call him a man. You're going to call him a monster! A man must see through his eyes and that's the way it must be. 

 """"Ashram has to be an ashram and it's not a motel. You don't go into a church and just start sleeping there and drinking your coffee there. You don't do that, do you? A church is a church, a temple is a temple; you are strict about doing certain things there. Understand? You go to a church; you pray, you meditate, you read something, you understand something, and become more spiritual, right? 

 """"Why should there be so much strictness? We are the children of God, and this is the house of God. That's why there should be so much strictness. That's the way it has to be, that's why. So that's what I wanted to make clear about it."""" 

 (Note: the above quotes are from Guru Maharaji himself. They've been lifted from satsangs Guru Maharaj Ji gave - during ashram pressure-cooker meetings - to the Ashram premies in the early 70s, and those quotes constitute the preface of the 'Ashram Manual'.) 

 Part One: The Renunciate Order 

 The Renunciate Order is a monastic order of Divine Light Mission. Its members pursue a life of complete worldly renunciation for the purpose of engaging in religious study and dedication to selfless service of God and humanity. Renunciates live in disciplined environments known as Ashrams, which are created and operated by Divine Light Mission for the spiritual growth of their members.

 I charge that   is a HARD CORE PARTISAN DEMOCRAT and is in complete conflict with WP:COI as to his edits on a REPUBLICAN OFFICE HOLDER""""S PERSONAL BIO.  

 Poof of this is simply found in is edits on wikpeida as well as off wikipedia on sites like 
 bens long history on democraticunderground.com Democratic Underground 

 With all the nice stuff ben spews on the DU site, I don't want a guy like this writing a """"NPOV"""" article about a Republican office holder with such views.  I believe ben should recuse himself from any editing on republican articles on wikpeida, less his KNOWN partisan views creep in to his copy. 

 Any reasonable person would not want his """"BIO"""" edited by such a partisan editor like Ben.

 :You have no right to """"insist"""" on anything, particularly a POV-pushing agenda to focus excessively on the state of Nevada (or Texas, for that matter). What you originally inserted into the article was several different edits that contained various content, most of which was irrelevant or inaccurate. Your new proposal is not acceptable because it puts undue weight on Nevada and the """"we must use all sources"""" argument is absurd, we could easily add five more books; Dobie's """"guess"""" is the outlier, and we don't need a bunch of other in-between guesses for here or there. All sources are not created equal and the 100,000 in Nevada is IRRELEVANT to the legislation. (Please read WP:UNDUE) I also took a look at your single legitimate original point - that the five million number in Evans seemed dodgy, and I agreed with you on that point, we are using the Dobie number simply because is so widely disseminated that it needs to be mentioned in a proper context.  Your edits to the lead, your rambling edits about Texas, and your """"extrapolation"""" of a wholly made up number (the 200,000 nonsense) was poorly done and inaccurate. At this point, I already proposed material on the BLM numbers of 1971 for the """"Implementation"""" section, where I think it fits. I would not object to some comment as to current numbers being added there and you can even say that the majority today are in Nevada if the stats verify that ( The language of the history section where Dobie is mentioned now is short, consied and puts Dobie's comment in context.

We don't do a """"stated by this expert and that expert"""" type of writing in wikipedia as much as you suggest, Evans is, as you pointed out, the editor of a horse encyclopedia.

 #Should we add info on the numbers the BLM found in the 1971 census?  I say yes if done concisely and properly sourced.   
 #If so, should we add the wording """" A census of animals in 1971 determined that there were approximately 17,300 horses and 8,045 burros found on lands subject to the Act.(ref to myths source already in article)."""" as I proposed above for the first paragraph of the """"implementation"""" section?  I like it, but am open to better ideas or improved, if brief phrasing.   
 #Should we add ANYTHING about estimates from Nevada circa 1900?  I say no, it's irrelevant because those numbers are guesses as much ad Dobie's, and unless we want to go on and make a chart of something that contains Orgon, Wyoming, etc., it's just trivia.   
 #Should we add any other estimates besides Dobie's 2 million number?  Maybe if there is another similarly respected source with an overall estimate (If Amaral estimates for the entire west, or if Ryden has numbers, I'd be interested in seeing these.) but I don't see a need for a laundry list, particularly one that is only for one state.

 Six months ago I anchored myself into Wikipedia history as the sole creator of the Ernest Scared Stupid article. It was my little niche in the World Wide Web, a place I could retreat to and acknowledge as my contribution to Planet Earth. 

 My happy little world was shattered a couple days ago when I made a daily visit to Wikipedia only to discover your modifications. The Ernest Scared Stupid article had been edited by other users in the past, and often to my disliking, but never to the degree that would warrant me trying to reform the changes made and eventually writing a letter voicing my disappointment. 

 You seem to have re-formatted every Ernest movie article in a very generic, formulaic format. All of “your articles” are bound by a bland sense of rule-following: Title, year, genre, star, director, plot, MPAA rating (and followed by) Cast, Plot, and Trivia. To your extensive editing I have the following to say: This is Wikipedia, not IMDB. 

 I don’t mind you adding facts such as MPAA rating, cast, etc. But do you have to do so in an ugly, database format? Believe it or not, each article of an encyclopedia (and especially a wiki encyclopedia) is unique and has artistic merit largely due to the fact that the articles are written by a diverse range of people and do not conform to one another. For example, the article on Guyana is formatted similar to, but not the same as, the article on Suriname. The photographs are not in the exact same spots and the Content Boxes are not identical. Would the Ernest films be so great if they were all bound by the same exact plot structure? 

 So congratulations, you have edited every single Ernest movie article. Any casual research on any Ernest film will feature ideas and information provided by a high school student from Connecticut (this fact is used merely to point out the narrowness of the source, not to discredit your age or location.) I seriously feel you are turning Wikipedia into a dull, Communist-style building complex. Ten gray buildings resting side by side, 24 rooms each, 48 windows, etc. Spice things up."

The two-party system sets these up as opposites to prevent the public from making the obvious conclusion from both of them: We are not, as it's fashionable to say, hurting the earth. We are hurting the artificial structures our ancestors have imposed upon the earth throughout the past 10000 years or so. If humanity goes extinct, the earth will return to the natural state of chaos it was in before humanity arose. If we were to take literally the environmentalists' exhortation to respect nature, we would be encouraged to continue changing the climate until we're all dead; because if nature is defined as something to which emotions can be shown, then our mere existence is disrespectful. On the contrary, the cause of actually protecting the environment  rather than just waxing poetic about it  has always been our duty to each other as fellow humans. 

 The religious conception of humanity as a category, disguised in secular garb, allows the false inference that if the economy puts some people inside a wall, other people must be outside. However, humanity is not a category; it is merely one of many instances of the category of animal species. So it is indeed possible for all people to be inside the wall. The establishment has brainwashed us into thinking that treating animals as the other leads to cruelty against them. On the contrary, cruelty against people called the other has always been based on the realization that they are in fact people and only the charade of cruelty can pretend otherwise. Furthermore, it is only by fabricating a connection with animals that a ritual of cruelty can be established to displace the natural tendency to treat them humanely.

 MILITARY OPERATIONS 1914-5 

 For some time before the year 1914 the close proximity of the German Protectorate of South-West Africa, sharing a common frontier on its southern and eastern borders with the Union of South Africa, had been recognized by the Union Government of South Africa as an important factor in its military arrangements. The sudden outbreak of war in Aug. 1914 at once converted a hypothetical situation for which tentative measures had been devised into a problem calling for immediate action. 

 On Aug. 6 1914 the Union Government undertook to assume all military obligations resting upon the British regular garrison in South Africa and to replace that force by Union troops. This offer was accepted by the Imperial Government, and the imperial military forces in South Africa became available else- where. On Aug. 10 the Union Government further undertook to send a military expedition of its own against German South-West Africa, and the seaports of that territory and the wireless installation at Windhuk were indicated by the British Government as the original objectives of the enterprise. 

 The position of South Africa on the ocean line of communication between Europe and Asia, and the necessity for denying friendly harbours and long-range communication to the enemy naval squadron under Adml. von Spee in the South Atlantic were obvious and imperative reasons for early action on the lines suggested. This decision of the Union Government, however, produced strong opposition on the part of a portion of the Dutch population of South Africa, and the antagonism to the proposed expedition culminated in open rebellion in Oct. 1914. Though the opposition to the Government was numerically insignificant—only some 11,500 rebels took up arms—the sporadic nature of the outbreak and the extent of the territory in which it occurred necessitated the employment of 30,000 troops (of which two-thirds were of Dutch descent) for its suppression, and delayed all offensive action across the border for four months. 

 Before the rebellion started the following preliminary movements had been carried out by Union troops for the prosecution of the campaign in South-West Africa. On Sept. 18 1914 a force, under Col. P. S. Beves, had been landed without opposition at Lüderitzbucht. On Aug. 31 a mixed force, under Brig.-Gen. H. T. Lukin, some 2,500 strong and including the regular mounted troops of the Union (the South African Mounted Riflemen), had begun to disembark at Port Nolloth, and, extending inland, was eventually disposed along the western portion of Union territory immediately adjoining the southern enemy border, with headquarters at Steinkopf. Farther eastward this line of observation was continued by another mixed force of approximately 1,000 rifles under Lt.-Col. Maritz with headquarters at Upington, and upon Maritz's desertion with the greater portion of his command to the enemy on Sept. 9 Col. Brits with another force took over the task which had been so shamefully abandoned. Col. Brits, called away to the Union, was soon replaced by Col. van Deventer, who, on the recall of Lukin's force on Oct. 23 to the Union, assumed sole command in the locality. Until the end of the rebellion, which was closed by the surrender of Kemp with his own and Maritz's rebel forces at Upington on Feb. 3 1915, the activities of all the forces first employed, with one exception, did not involve anything beyond outpost and reconnaissance work. A more ambitious undertaking ended in the capture of a strong advanced detachment of the South African Mounted Riflemen with two guns at Sandfontein, in enemy territory, on Sept. 26. 

 The beginning of Feb. 1915 then may be taken as the time of the actual commencement of offensive action by the Union forces in and against German South-West Africa. The circumstances attending the problem which confronted the South African military commanders may be briefly summarized as follows: The greater portion of what was formerly German South-West Africa"

 Okay, here goes: 

  I do agree that there needs to be an objective, agreed-upon criterion for inclusion.  I also agree that square footage is not a good criterion because many colleges own a lot of land that isn't currently used for academic purposes. 

  Harvard and Tufts really are the extreme cases that warrant inclusion - Harvard has four of its eleven schools in Boston, and Tufts has four of its eight schools in Boston.  My thoughts are that a good criterion is whether there is at least one entire """"school"""" there, being defined as a degree-granting major administrative division of the university. 

  The BU Corporate Education center isn't degree-granting .  I don't see anything about a second major campus in the Northeastern article, and anything outside the 128 wouldn't pertain to this article.  If there are any other cases of an entire degree-granding school being in another city, I'm sure someone would have brought it up already or will add it in the future. 

  I will agree that Tufts spilling over into Somerville doesn't warrant a mention, especially since it seems to be only a small portion of the campus. 

 Again, I don't think that double-barrelled locations for a few institutions will make the list unwieldy, and I do think that there's a clear enough difference between an entire school and the mentioned sattelite centers that there (hopefully) shouldn't be borderline cases.

 ==Massacre or Killing Spree? == 
 Should we refer to this incident as """"Massacre"""" or a """"Killing Spree""""? 
 I think we should change the term """"Killing spree"""" to """"Massacre"""". A Massacre is """"deliberately and violently kill (a large number of people)"""". Which is what the perpetrator did and how it has been described in the media:http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isla-vista-rampage/isla-vista-massacre-what-do-we-know-about-elliot-rodgers-n114416 It is also how it is described by Elliot Rodger himself. It was one incident. Spree killers usually span weeks: """"that spree killers """"will engage in the killing acts for days or weeks"""" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spree_killer Elliot killed his roommates on the same day he went to kill people in IV. 
 What do others think? I feel using """"Killing Spree"""" is misrepresenting this event, especially that it lasted several weeks or days. It was ONE day. 
 :A massacre is committed by a group.    

 """"Group"""" refers to the perpetuating party. In this case the party was Elliot Rodgers. Also the article you shared says:  and the perpetrating party is perceived as in total control of force while the victimized party is perceived as helpless or innocent.  Which is what happened in IV. 
 Killing Spree is incorrect because it refers to several days. The article on Killing Sprees names various individuals who committed a massacre. 
 The murders took place in ONE day not several weeks. What do others think? would it be OK if I change the term? Sorry about editing earlier I am a new female, who loves Wikipedia. I did not know the norms in detail. Thanks for the feedback.

As for your question, I agree with your mindset and intentions, but I guess I have two questions.  I assume you are asking about the 2009 Women's Professional Soccer season article and not the Women's Professional Soccer article, correct?  If that is the case I would ask where the two articles are that divergent from each other?  If you mean the main WPS article, then I guess I would still agree with your premise, but given the fact that the league is still in its infancy, I don't know how well that would work.  I mean, I agree that every league's article should have roughly the same components: a history section, some information about the clubs that currently comprise the league, some details about the competition, and other notable topics of interest.  The problem is that the sections of the article relating to soccer-specific stadiums, expansion, and rule changes, just for example, were developed by necessity because over MLS's history those have been critical issues for the league.  I don't know if those are necessarily appropriate topics for a WPS article, and that will only be fleshed out over time.  As for the issue of whether it is kosher to just copy the text of an article into another, the answer is absolutely.  I created the 2009 Major League Soccer season article by copying the 2008 article and changing or updating where appropriate.  You don't want to move articles that way, but for creating new articles, especially about recurring things like sports seasons, elections, etc. that is a completely acceptable way of doing things.

You may feel that defending the Serbian position is an automatic slap in the face for those that fought against them in the 1990s but most of the commentary attacks the world governments (cheifly US) and organisations such as the EU, the UN and their excrements such as the ICTY. The two parties you mentioned to organise the protests are as you correctly state far-right by their own admission. Who organises an event is one thing, who attends is totally different.

Sinđelić will turn in his grave but the sweets we are given taste too nice to resist!"""". Naturally Timbouctou, what a government does is its own choice but attending a demonstration opposing extradition of Mladić no more makes one a """"nationalist"""" than those who opposed Gotovina's trial were. There were demonstrations in Croatia and many I knew to attend were Titoists or supporters of SDP, liberals and non-right wing parties, or HDZ which is moderate right in all truth even if it had its fingers in a few pies in the 1990s. As for radicals, they have almost a quarter of the support in Serbia making them a major party. A great many SRS gatherings - but for lesser events such as upcoming elections - can often attract a sea of people waving blue flags. I know one or two radicals in Novi Sad, I phoned one of them to ask if he were going (he's a lawyer) and he replied that he wouldn't and neither would many because they knew it to be a """"futile non-event"""".

 Hello and welcome to Wikipedia. Thank you for . I hope you like the place and decide to stay. The following links will help you begin editing on Wikipedia: 
 *The five pillars of Wikipedia 
 *How to edit a page 
 *Editing tutorial 
 *Picture tutorial 
 *How to write a great article 
 *Naming conventions 
 *Simplified Manual of Style 

 ;Please bear these points in mind while editing Wikipedia: 
 * Respect copyrights – do not copy and paste text or images directly from other websites. 
 * Maintain a neutral point of view – this is one of Wikipedia's core policies. 
 * Take particular care while adding biographical material about a living person to any Wikipedia page and follow Wikipedia's Biography of Living Persons policy. Particularly, controversial and negative statements should be referenced with multiple reliable sources. 
 * No edit warring or sock puppetry. 
 * If you are testing, please use the Sandbox to [ do so]. 
 * Do not add troublesome content to any article, such as: copyrighted text, libel, advertising or promotional messages, and text that is not related to an article's subject. Deliberately adding such content or otherwise editing articles maliciously is considered vandalism; doing so will result in your account or IP being blocked from editing. 
 * Do not use talk pages as discussion or forum pages as Wikipedia is not a forum. 

 The Wikipedia tutorial is a good place to start learning about Wikipedia. If you have any questions, see the help pages, add a question to the village pump or ask me on .

On my talk page, you said """"I can't go against human nature and let someone slap me in the face and turn the other cheek. I can't allow arrogant users to believe what they are doing is right or to kiss their ass. I can't allow my freedoms to be taken away. And the bottom line is that this is so bad, I can leave Wikipedia and we can both be happy."""" 

 Allow me to give you a hypothetical set of responses to, as you have said, an """"arrogant pompous user"""" who has greatly angered you with something they have done to your user page. You could respond by undoing the vandalism and... 
 # Sending them a message """"Please do not vandalize my user page, or indeed any other page on Wikipedia. If you continue to vandalize, I will take appropriate steps to have your account banned. Thank you."""" 
 or 
 # Sending them a message """"You fucking asshole! Good fucking grief, is your life so pathetically empty that you have to go vandalizing people's user pages to find a sense of self worth in your worthless existence you call a life? Go get a fucking clue, and get off Wikipedia while you're at it! Oh, and have a plate-full of shit and eat it with a fucking rusty fork! When you're done with that, stick your head up your ass and lick up your desert, prick!"""" 
 Now, you haven't responded like the second response above. But, your responses to people have been considerably closer to (2) at times than to (1).  

 Let's take a step back from this and take an above-the-trees look at the situation. What are your goals? The only goal that I can see is to stop the user vandalizing your user page, or any page on Wikipedia. Defending your honor in front of these people is not a worthwhile goal. You've never met these people, likely never will, and their opinions of you have absolutely no bearing on your life. Furthermore, your anger with them will not cause them to stop vandalizing your user page. Nothing that you can say to them in anger is going to do anything to stop them from doing more vandalizing. You have no physical way of stopping them. Using anger at them isn't going to make the situation any better. If instead you warn the user and later involve an admin if they continue (feel free to ask me to step in by the way), you can get the individual blocked, and/or have your user page temporarily protected.  

 When a user angers me (and they do at times) it's not a matter of turning the cheek. I recognize the relative importance in my life of the people here; they have no..zero..zip...nadda..impact on my life. Their opinions of me do not matter. Anger is not a response that is going to yield anything productive. When you removed my comments to you on your user page following your withdrawn RfA and in the edit summary said """"rv assholes"""", I could have taken great offense, and responded to you in like manner, calling you an asshole for ignoring my attempts to help you. Instead, I attempted to re-engage you in discussion. Result? We're talking again! That's good! That's productive! If I'd gotten angry with you, you'd be pissed off, I'd be pissed off, and nothing positive would have happened.  

 I can write just as much vitriol as anyone else can. I spent 8 years in the US Navy Reserves. I can dress someone down with insults with the best of them and leave them crying for their mommies. But, it sure doesn't prove to anyone that I am any more of a 'man', or get them to do what I want them to do. As you say, human nature is to respond to anger with anger. Where does it stop? FOCUS on the goals you want to achieve. IDENTIFY what tasks you need to do to achieve those goals. GO AFTER those tasks with all of your intelligence. With those steps you will achieve great things. If you instead choose to get angry whenever someone upsets you, you are no better than an animal force to respond to the demands of your DNA; completely subservient to 'human nature' and incapable of rising about the primordial muck and becoming something more.  

 Nobody will respect you for being able to dish out hate-filled vitriol. People will respect you for being a leader, and resolving situations in a calm, mature manner. You are very intelligent. Don't waste yourself in the primordial muck of 'human nature'. Aspire to be better.

 Your request to be unblocked has been granted for the following reason(s): 

 Having received permission from Jehochman to unblock, I'll add that I nonetheless remain disappointed that he has issued this block without providing anything concrete (at least concrete enough to the satisfaction of Dmcdevit and myself ). As for Adam Cuerden's declining the request, I'm not sure how to respond to that, except to note that reviewing unblock requests isn't a mere formality, or limited to the most obvious cases. More judicious, informed, and informative/informational review is needed. Further, Gnangarra blocking the ip was poorly rationalized. A lot of, unfortunately, looks like groupthink, which needs to be avoided at all costs. I also note in disappointment the original account of wrongdoing by Arcayne, which was poorly organized, dated, assembled, and so on. That so many of the above individuals, however, took the claims in Arcayne's account at face value, is just as problematic, if not more so. The epitome of that, I felt, was Relata refero's claim that DreamGuy """"violated 3RR pretty badly,"""" but refused to point out to me the diffs from Arcayne's account that made him arrive at this conclusion, instead, instructing me to """"plow through the diffs [myself].""""

123153,با عرض سلام خدمت رياست جمهوري کشور جناب آقاي روحاني و ضمن تشکر از توجهات به متون مباحثه من اولش فکر ميکردم که شما متون مباحثات رو پاک کردين که بعد متوجه شدم نه در يک بخش مجزا از پيجتون قرار دادين.که متوجه شدم نه اين مباحثات رو رويت کردين و قابت توجهتون بوده.از اين بابت تشکر ميکنم و سعي ميکنم در هر موضوعي که مطرح ميشه هرچند ديگه چيزي به مباحثات ايران و آمريکا نمونده فکر کنم حدود دو مباحثه ديگه علاوه بر اين مونده که برسيم به مباحثات ايران وآمريکا.من در قسمت از مباحثاتي که براتون با يک موضوع خاص عنوان کردم سعي کردم از تمام جوانب اون موضع بگم ولي مهخم اين هستش آقاي روحاني که به مرحله اجرا برسه چون تاييد تازه مرحله مقدماتي از يک اقدام هستش مهم ترين مرحله مرحله اجرا هستش .خب موضوعي که امروز قرار در مورد تشکيل مباحثه داشته باشيم موضوع تعامل اجتماعي هستش و نقش اون در زندگي اجتماعي و نحوه اجراي درست اون در زندگي اجتماعي و همکاري اجتماعي و نقش و نحوه اجراي درست اون در جامعه و سپس روابط اين دو با هم در زندگي اجتماعي.موضوع مباحقه اين دفع خيلي طولاني هستش اما مفاهيمي که در اون مطرح ميشه بنظرم مي تونه يکي از عوامل  و مشکلات اساسي در جامعه باشه چون شامل دو بخش هست از داد و ستد هاي اجتماعي مطرح شده تا همکاري هاي هم وطنانه و از جايگاه و نحوه اجراي درست در هرکدام از اون بحث گراني ها نسبت به اشارات کوتاهي که اگه يادتون باشه در مباحثات قبلي به کار بردم خيلي واضح تر و موشکافانه تر بهش مي پردازيم همچنين فرصت مناسبي هست که در مورد وضعيت سربازان و مسله هنرمند آقاي تتلو و ايجاد فرصتي براي فعاليت هنري ايشان و کاهش ممانعت هايي که براشون بعد از بازداتشون ايجاد شد و وضعيت هنرمندان ممنوع الورود به کشور و در کل ايرانيان ممنوع الورود به کشور وضعيت هنري و وروزشي موشکافانه تر بپردازيم در بخش همکاري اجتماعي چون وقتي صحبت از همکاري ميشه فقط همکاري بين هم وطنان نيست بلکه مسئولين با مردم و حتي در مقياس وسيع تر در سطح جهاني ميشه ارزيابي کردش پس مي تونه موضوع گستردذه اي باشه در مورد سربازان البته من مفصل در ارسال نامه براي رهبر و براي پليس کشور عنوان کردم که هرچه سريع تر اقدام کنند هرچند مي دونم رسيدگي به جرم مجرمان قاچاقچي نياز به وقت داره و اين بابت من حق رو به شما مي دم چون قاچاق اگه مواد مخدر باشه مي تونه جون هزاران جوون رو به خاطر بندازه و اين کار از جانب شما بابت جلوگيري از قاچاق اقدام کاملا درستيه و حتي اگع جنس و کالا باشه بازم اقدامتون درسته چون اگه مال ايران باشه من کاملا موافقم که جلوگيري شده و سريع پليس کشور تونست دستگيرشون کنه چون سرمايه ملي هست اما يه مسئله ديگه هم وجود داره و من به اين خاطر ميگم که اگه اين مسئه زندانيان قاچاقچي رو که به قول خمودشون زندانيان سني هستن با مدنظر گرفتن شرايط قانوني مشخص کنيد تا سربازان باقيمانده بيگناه خدايي ناکرده بلايي سرشون نياد آقاي روحاني من حتي خواهان اين هستم که جواب خون اين جوون بيگناه که به دست مزدوران سني جيش العدل دستگير شدن مشخص شه البته اينم مي دونم هزاران نفر مثل ايشون در راه حق شهيد شدن چه بسا که همون طور که خون اونا پايمال نشده خون اين جوان بيگناه که شهيد شده هم پايمال نشه.من خيلي تاکيد دارم آقاي روحاني که سريعا اين مسئله حل بشه چون واقعا وقتي شنيدم يکي از اون سربازان شهيد شدن بهشخصه عذاب وجدان گرفتم که چرا سکوت کردم خواهشمندم سريعا رسيدگي کنيد.متشکر از شما اين صحبت از مسئله سربازان و حال از اين مسئه که درواقع نوع همکاري مسئولين کشور با احاط ملت ايران هست وارد اصل موضوع ميشم اول از همه به تعامل ميپردازيم که مسئله رايج در روابط اجتماعي که کلي شاکي هم داره مسئله داد و ستد هستش و علت شاکي بودنش تنوع در صحبت اخبار و بازار فروش و خريد هستش حالا فقط جمعيت اين کاکيان مردم نيستن بلکه بازاري ها و کسانيکه کارشون فروش هستش بيشتر.البته ميشه مسئله تحريم رو قرار داد که هم ون طور که مطلع هستم انگار دباره فشار وارد شده در اين زمينه و افزايش و کاهش ناگهاني ارز نمونه اوناست که تاثير ميزاره رو قيمت کالا البته فراوان کالا هم داريم چون قبلا که شرايط تحريم سنگين تر بود حتي بازار لوازم الکتريکي و فروش يخچال ال جي محصولات خودشونو در انبار ميزاشتن اما با ورود مدل هاي جديد اون محصولات رو براي فروش در مغازها قرار دادن تنوع لوازم الکتريکي با مارک هاي متفاوت زياد شده و قيمت هاي ايده آل اما خب خودتون مي دونيد هرکس دنبال بهترين مارک هستش با کيفيت عالي که زبان عاميانه اي که در اين زمينه به کار ميبرن ميگن حالا که داريم پول ميديم بريم بهترين مارکشو بگيريم با جنس ايده ال.متاسفانه يه ايرادي هم وجود داره اونم کيفيت کالا هستش که متاسفانه پايين از قبل بوده و الان بيشتر شده من اين امار رو در لوازم الکتريکي بيشتر ديدم از لپ و تاپ و نوت بوک گرفته تا لوازم خونه.که آمارشان در لپ تاپ و وسايل ارتباطي بيشتر به چشم ميخوره که در تعميرگاه بعد از استفاده کوتاهي شمار خرابي هاي در دستگاه ها بيشتر ميشه لوازم التريکي از اون تعريفي که فروشندگان از توانايي دستگاه ميکنند باز اگه بگم يک درصد دو درصد اما ديگه ازگه بالا پنجاه درصدش پايين تر باشه ديگه خيلي هست اما خب نميگم الان وضعيت دادن گارانتي بد شده نه الان نسبت به اون زمان اوج تحريم که اصلا خيلي گارالنتي هاغير فعال شده بود اما اکنون فعال شده اما باز هست مدل هايي که دادن گارانتي براي اون يکم مشکل داره فعالا که بهترين گارانتي رو مدل سامسونگ در ايران ميده که تحت عنوان گارانتي طلايي هستش براي همين حتي در مورد يخچال ديگه افراد به جاي اينکه بيشتر سراغ جنس ال جي که بهترين مارک يخچال هست برن ميرن سراغ سامسونگ و حتي گوشي و تبلت .اين تنوع مدل هاي لوازم الکتريکي و مدل هاي کالاهايي که والا من حتي خيلي هاشون به گوشم نخورده اصلا داراي گارانتي نيستن و فرد به خاطر ايبنکه پول کافي براي خريد اجناس

 * It is not a substitute for the talk pages:  the dispute must have been discussed extensively on a talk page (not just through edit summaries) before resorting to DRN. 
 * It is not a court with judges or arbitrators that issue binding decisions: we focus on resolving disputes through consensus, compromise, and explanation of policy. 

  

 * Discussions should be civil, calm, concise, neutral, and objective.  Comment only about the article's content, not the other editors.   Participants who go off-topic or become uncivil may be asked to leave the discussion.

 == P90x Link == 

 Hello, I noticed you removed the link to fitnesstrainingreview from the P90x article.  First, let me explain that I know Chelsea from that article, as she was in a class of mine.  She was always talking to me about p90x whenever I was complaining about my shape.  She gave me a link to a website she was starting (fitnesstrainingreview) as well some other info on P90x.  About a week later I was doing more research on P90x and came across the wiki article which had the phrase """"The program has three “rotations”—classic, lean, and doubles"""" said citation needed.  Fast forward a few months, I ended up buying P90x and doing more p90x searches on google when I considered creating my own blog to hold myself accountable.  I saw that the p90x wiki was still saying citation needed for that quite and remembered reading that exactly on Chelsea's blog on her new post.  I then decided to link her site in the middle of the summer. 

 Now your reasoning was that it was not a reputable source.  First I want to begin by asking what exactly is a reputable source as far as a workout video goes?  I personally know that Chelsea is about as filled with p90x knowledge as anyone possibly could be.  She has been able to answer any question I throw at her immediately about p90x.  She even leads p90x workouts on our campus.  Recently she was talking to me about people who had emailed her questions and mentioned finding her site via wikipedia and thanked her so much for all of her help, .  Lastly I wanted to say that this link has been on the wiki page for about 6 months and has been through just shy of 200 revisions.   

 I honestly think that taking this link and source away from the wiki article is just hurting potential visitors of the wiki.  As you can probably tell I am very inexperienced with wikipedia, and I probably wasn't supposed to just undo people's edits.  I am sorry I did not contact you here first.  Let me know what you think about all of this, and have a nice day. — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •  12:44, 7 February 2011 
 :Hi, don't worry about being inexperienced - everyone is at first! I don't know Chelsea, but I don't doubt what you say that she has a lot of knowledge about the P90X, and I'm sure her blog is a great resource for people interested in it. In the real world, as you seem to have found, it may be that her blog can be considered """"reliable"""" and """"reputable"""". On Wikipedia though, our guidelines for what to use as a source are very strict. You can read about them at Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources. Blogs are very rarely considered """"reliable"""" enough to use in articles here. They are often self-published sources, meaning that somebody writes something and publishes it themselves, for example on their blog or website. Sometimes people write books and publish them themselves. They don't have anyone whose job it is to check over their work, and they are not backed up by a reliable company. What Chelsea has on her blog might be factually correct, but how can we know that for sure.

What i find the most frustrating about the whole school debate is I get accused of being a deletionist, which i am not.  But some articles are just so horrific that deletion makes perfect sense.

 == 'Fuck' is related to 'do' and therefore a euphermism == 

 Look at the examples used on the main page. In British English it is common to replace the ‘fuck’ with ‘do’. The Latin for ‘do’ is ‘facio’. It is phonetically similar. 

 ‘Do the wife’ or ‘Do her’, to have sexual intercourse with the said person (Britsh English) 
 ‘Do/Be off with you’, as a command, to leave forthwith, go away; (British English) 
 ‘Do him in’, to assault the said person violently (British English) 
 ‘Do over’, to take advantage of, exploit or assault violently (British English) 
 ‘Done in’, to be bungled, ruined, spoiled or ‘wounded by violent assault’. (British English) 
 ‘Do away with’, to no longer meddle with. (British English) 
 ‘Mess about’, to act foolishly or stupidly (or alternatively to be unfaithful to one's partner or spouse). (British English) 

 These are all with, respect euphermismism, for the word """"fuck"""". If """"fuck"""", or 'facio' meant """"do"""" then they were also in turn using euphemisms.‘Make love’ is another euphemism for sexual intercourse and ‘make’ and ‘do’ are interchangeable in some instances in Latin. 

 The Roman’s invaded with many new skills and would explain with simplified Latin. To simplify a verb simply use the word ‘do’ in order give instruction. E.g. ‘I am going to ‘do’ a mile today’ rather than ‘I am going to ‘run’ a mile today’ thus all the examples that site European influence could in turn be referring to Latin origin. A Roman is instucting a slave to ‘saw’ wood; the Roman says ‘do’ the wood because the slave does not understand the word ‘saw’. The slave may then assume ‘do’ is the correct verb for ‘sawing’. The ‘grinding and thrusting motion’ of wood sawing is then used as a euphemism for intercourse. Also just because the Romans did not invade the country Etymologist cite as the source for 'fuck' does not mean that they did not share skills and use the 'do' as the verb. 

 Therefore, if someone tells you to use a euphemism instead of just saying “fuck”, truly you are already using a euphemism.

 Annie, I was surprised to see here that there are plans not only to continue at Pune but even to expand to another campus.  I am sure that this is all still under discussion, but speaking as someone who has put quite a few hours into the IEP cleanup already, and who expects to have to do many more, I would be very disappointed if the program continues in anything like its current form.  I understand the post mortem is continuing, and I hope that the revised IEP plan for next semester will be on a scale that won't cause anything like the current impact, but because of the scale of the additional work caused I think a great many people will be very upset if there is not a very clear dialogue with the community about your plans before you commit to the IEP's next incarnation.  I've argued that the community should be more involved with the discussions about the future of the USEP, as you know; but as I've said in those discussions I think the USEP is in pretty good shape and if you decide to go in a different direction to the one I've suggested I think it will be OK.  For the IEP the stakes are much higher and I would really like to see these discussions take place on-wiki, at least simultaneously with the mailing list discussions.  Thanks    -  -  )"

 == Cyclone Studios == 
 hello, I'm gezegond, and you deleted my page some time a go. the reason that I'm writing this is that I'm a newcomer to wikipedia and I don't understand why you deleted my page, but from your User page I understood that you're someone that deletes a lot of pages. Before I began writing in wikipedia, I used it a lot to get info and after some time I felt that it's time to add some info my won. I read all the guidelines before I started writing in wikipedia. The page that you deleted """"Cyclone Studios"""" took me 5 to 6 hours to complete, I gathered data about it and I carefully added to wikipedia. Of course  it was not perfect. It didn't have any real good sourced material and It might not have enough notability, but It was some info about something that wikipedia had nothing to offer about it before. 3 or 4 pages were linked to the page and when people clicked the links they would face a """"page does not exist"""" note. so I put some info I could find together and created the page to help other people. It lacked notability but it was not a stub, and it was sourced. Wikipedia guidelines say that if a page lacks notability you should improve it by adding some references, and if it lacks sources you should find sources on your own. It clearly says that deleting is the last resort if the page can't be anyhow improved. Yet you easily deleted my page. I was busy and I couldn't check my Wikipedia page and when I checked it I realized that my page is completely gone. no """"add references"""" sign, no """"lacks notability"""" sign. Just gone. and I'm not unhappy because you deleted my page but because you actually believe that you did the right thing! I think you are making improving wikipedia harder. deleting is not improving and bad data is better than no data. if you don't think it's not good enough, then make it good enough. deleting won't help. no page starts out being perfect. this act of yours makes professional wikipedia users the only ones who can add or edit a page because if someone can't make his page perfect, It gets deleted, which means that no info can't be added to wikipedia unless it's added by a professional wikipedia user and it's completely favorable to wikipedias structure, which is not very likely. So please answer me (on my talk page although i don't check it often) and correct me if I'm wrong. If wikipedia's content is """"be perfect or not be there at all"""" I might stop adding info to wikipedia, But I've seen a lot of pages that lack both reference and notability and are not deleted.

 == what can I say to convince you to change with the best intentions of the people, humanity, and the poor in mind; please read what I have to say and they support democracy, freedom, liberty, and most of all the democratic party == 

 The Tea Party, a fundamentalist wing of the Republican Party, differs from the GOP only in their level of fanatical extremism. The Tea Party is in lockstep with the GOP on every economic issue. Where they differ is on social issues... you know... questioning whether President Obama was even born in the United States or whether or not the minimum wage is Constitutional. 

 Department of Defense can’t account for 96 percent of money administered in Iraq reconstruction fund (between 2003-2007, $9.1 Billion just vanished). 

 Deficit fraud Shadegg (R-WI) can’t name a single program he'd cut to reduce the deficit. 

 The GOP has become the """"Let Them Eat Want Ads"""" Caucus: A look at all the Conservatives claiming people on unemployment are """"lazy"""" and are simply """"putting off looking for work"""". 

 Speaking of which: TN Congressman running for governor, Zach Wamp (R-TN) Suggests Unemployed Are ‘Just Sitting Back Waiting’. 

 Sharon Angle - The Tea Party's pick to replace Nevada Senator Harry Reid is too BSC even for Fox News with all her talk of """"armed insurrection"""" and """"Second Amendment remedies"""" if voters don't return Conservatives to power in Congress. 

 House minority whip Eric Cantor Admits Extending Bush Tax Cuts Would ‘Dig The Hole Deeper’ on the Deficit and can't name a single program he'd cut to pay for it (continue reading the list and you'll find he's not the only Deficit Hawk that can't name a single thing he'd cut.) 

 But that's not the first time a Republican admits the truth about the effect of tax cuts on the Deficit: GOP Lawmaker Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) Slips Up, Admits Tax Cuts Will ‘Increase The Debt’. 

 Not convinced yet? Contradicting His Earlier Denial, Marco Rubio (R-FL) Admits ‘Tax Cuts Don’t Pay For Themselves’. 

 Don't ask these guys how they'll pay for extending the Bush Tax Cuts. Either they don't know or won't say before the election because they know you won't like it (can you say """"Social Security & Medicare"""" after they spent all of last Summer vowing to protect it?) 

 The man in charge of rewriting history on the Bush Administration, Rove Invents Fantasy World In Which The Bush Tax Cuts Led To The Most Government Revenue Ever. (So how did they double the National Debt in six years with """"all that revenue"""" coming in?) 

 Tea Party Senate candidate Rand Paul (R-TN) claims mine safety regulations are unnecessary because ‘no one will apply’ for jobs at dangerous mines. - So, mines will simply go out of business after 100% of them deregulate and workers choose to starve rather than work for them? (They can just live off their Trust Funds until a better job comes along, right Rand?) 

 Rep. Mike Pence (R-IN) Can’t Think Of Any GOP Ideas That Are Different From Bush. Says Simply: We Are ‘Pro-Growth’. (whatever that means.) 

 Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell Filibusters DISCLOSE Act After Decades Of Demanding Campaign Finance Reform - As recently as 2007, McConnell was still defending his 23 year effort to require candidates to disclose who was donating to their campaigns. Now, suddenly, he's filibustering something he has fought for for years. Why? Because Democrats want it too. It's all part of """"the Party of Record Obstructionism simply to deny Democrats of any achievements prior to the election. Will you reward them for it in November?) 

 MSNBC's Rachel Maddow takes note of McConnell's flip-flop, producing video proof of numerous Republicans now vehemently opposed to programs & policies THEY themselves invented. (Can you say """"Cap & Trade"""" McCain, Palin, Fiorina?) 

 And WHY would Republicans now obstruct their own programs? Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) says the answer is obvious: Republicans ‘Don’t Want People To Get Jobs Before The Election’ . I think he's right. 

 People that think like this have no business being in charge of ANYTHING: Carnival offers shoot-the-president game. 

 On Sunday's Meet the Press, House Minority Leader John Boehner (R-OH) called for more deregulation to jumpstart the economy, then IN THE SAME BREATH, blamed a lack of regulation for the crisis on Wall Street and the oil disaster in the Gulf: 

 GOP Repeats Balanced Budget Amendment Farce - Why is this bad? Because they are still insisting on extending the $700B budget-busting Bush Tax cut for the wealthiest 2% while (almost comically) steadfastly refusing to explain how they'll pay for it.

 What a shameful website! Not only does it ban users who show liberal points of view, or points of view that do not agree with neo-con doctrine, but it also rejects some CONSERVATIVE points of view. Its basically an encyclopedia written only from Christian points of view, and Christianity is given a defacto statement of being true, while other religions are treated as suspect. 

 Also, on its page on Wikipedia, it states that Wikipedia founders once owned a pornsite. Hmmm, the purpose of that was... what? Most likely to show bias against Wikipedia. """"oooh looky here, they owned a pornsite, they must obviously be bad people!"""" 

 Wikipedia will have articles that show up as biased, because anyone can edit them. There is no preference to who is right or wrong. all meet, discuss, and eventually settle.

You should honestly investigate claimed supernatural phenomena so you don't live bad lives and end up in Hell.  You're the irrational one by insisting without proper investigation that such phenomena is automatically bogus.  And shame on the next dude for just parroting a false and malicious conclusion.  You show forth your stupidity in the most abberant manner.  I am a real scientist and I have examined what evidence is available to me regarding claims about Therese Neumann.  She was a Saint and her phenomena proof of the truth of Catholicism, which she herself indicates by her manner of life.  She's not an isolated case.  There's thousands of well-documented and reliable accounts of modern and past supernatural phenomena on the part of Catholic Saints that backs up their claims that Jesus founded the Catholic Church and that it's the only true religion. 

 Everybody with wisdom realizes Wikipedia has a heavy liberal bias and won't give us the truth on almost anything.  Giving both sides of the story here is not truth.  Therese Neumann is one of thousands of messages from God to the world that it should be Catholic. 

 And Neumann, if the yogi dude isn't lying, probably either didn't understand his words (Eastern religious jargon) or just wanted to be nice and not cause a fight.  If he wanted her opinion, in Western cultures, you ask the person straight-forward.  Hinduisms are not at all like Catholicism.  Hinduisms are more like 'I think I am one, therefore I am'.  Catholics are Catholics only if they do and say what the Church defines that Catholics do.  E.G. murderers commit a mortal sin and stop being Catholics.  And I'll be honest with you, guys like that would lie about what she said just to use her for their scheme.  It seems more in line with what honest people record her saying that she told him he'd go to Hell if he didn't become a Catholic.

 == Article illustration - A rationale == 

 I got onto this page from the discussion from a thread over censorship on this site. It's important therefore to note and what I am about to say is that I did not search for this article. 

 What I can conclude is that there are disproportionate number of sad bastards who edit Wikipedia, if they don't realise why the image """"to illustrate this page"""" causes so much disruption. 

 Does Wikipedia need to pander to the sad beggers who would actually go searching for this twaddle? Is it vitally important that a textual description is not enough? Or that a picture is of the upmost importance to help """"visualise"""" what sucking your own cock looks like???  

 I see the main problem here is basic responsibility and has nothing to do with censorship. Censorship, using Wikipedia's own definition: 

 """"'....is the suppression of speech or deletion of communicative material which may be considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, or inconvenient to the government or media organizations as determined by a censor."""" 

 In this case, the sex act is fully recorded and described in ridiculous detail. It is not about censorship. 

 However responsibility refers to how this information is used and presented.  And that is completely lacking here! I am sorry if this argument has been made before but, if Wikipedia is to have articles on such crap would it not be prudent, using the logic behind this image, to illustrate every single one with graphic scenes that are described in the text. 

 To me, this debate (and it won't end) is all about how long a bunch of saddos can use play the rules so that an unnecessary image of a guy blowing himself can remain on this page.

 To reply on what Frank Close actually says: 

 ;Extracts from Chapter 9, The Infinity Puzzle, 2013. Relevant snips underlined, rest is to add context 
 * Although several people discovered the mechanism whereby vector gauge bosons can acquire mass, Brout and Englert being the first to publish a relativistic demonstration, only Higgs drew attention to the consequential existence of a massive scalar particle, which now bears his name. 

 * By the late summer of 1964 they [Guralnik and Hagen] had """"pretty much everything but still had concerns over some fine details."""" His former mentor Walter Gilbert was lecturing at a summer school at Lake Como, so Guralnik made a special trip to tell him what they had achieved.... At the very time when Guralnik was talking with Gilbert, Higgs’s paper was already in production. This would become apparent only later... 

 * Unaware of this even more precious jewel that lay just out of their reach, Guralnik and Hagen drafted a manuscript, and showed it to Kibble, asking for any additional input. Fate was about to deal them a cruel blow. During 1964 Britain had had a series of postal strikes, which had delayed the mail. Their memory of events, as described in several accounts,[29] is that as they were about to send the final version of their manuscript to PRL, Kibble came in and announced that in the backlog of mail were """"three papers, one by Robert Brout and François Englert... and two by Peter Higgs."""" All three also seemed to have discovered how a gauge boson could become massive.  

 * Guralnik, Hagen, and Kibble’s work was tightly argued and contained unique insights toward understanding the depth of these new ideas. However, the sad fact was that they had been scooped. They added references to those papers into the text but changed nothing, nor did they add anything as a result of what had happened. They sent the manuscript to Physical Review Letters, where it was received on October 12, 1964.... By that oversight, they had implicitly placed themselves as runners-up... 

 * Gerald Guralnik was one of those who approached the finishing line early but failed to publish fast enough. 

 * In another of the coincidences in this tale, the editor of PRL received Higgs’s manuscript on the very same day that Brout and Englert’s paper was published. When Higgs’s paper finally appeared in print, on October 19, Brout and Englert were surprised to see that it included a reference to their own: """"He couldn’t have seen our paper, so how did he know of it?"""" Higgs explained: Nambu had been the referee of both papers and """"had drawn attention to the work of Brout and Englert. I added a remark about their work."""" Their researches were truly independent; in 1964 manuscripts were typed and then submitted by the regular mail. [...] There is no dispute that Brout and Englert were first to complete and first to publish. So why is it that Higgs’s name is associated with the massive boson and not those of Englert or Brout? The answer is that so far everyone has been addressing what happened to Goldstone’s massless boson. However, there remains the issue of Goldstone’s other boson—the massive one. This is what Higgs had uniquely included in his revised paper, the one that appeared in PRL. Two years later, he developed the ideas in a longer paper, setting in motion the events that would make his name. 

 * So it was that Brout, Englert, and Higgs had all published papers, while GHK were writing their own paper, ignorant of developments due to the British postal strike until the fateful moment when Kibble announced the news. 

 * Tom Kibble recalled: """"As a matter of fact [in 1964] the Higgs Boson was not seen by anyone as a particularly important feature. The interest [then] was in the way the gauge vector bosons acquired a mass, eating up the Goldstone [massless] Boson on the way. Now of course it’s important because... its observation would confirm the validity of the theory."""" ... Kibble’s perception of the perceived unimportance historically is in accord with the memories of others, which were aired when the six shared the Sakurai Prize in 2010. For Englert and Brout, """"This was our first paper in field theory and we were somewhat isolated. We didn’t know about Glashow’s work [on the SU2 × U1 model of the weak and electromagnetic forces] at all."""" 

 * During the International Conference on High Energy Physics at Berkeley in 1966, Ben Lee prominently referred to the “Higgs Boson” and the “Higgs Mechanism.” ... As the GHK team, including Hagen, had not completed their paper until after the appearance of Higgs’s original papers, and as Higgs had built on this further during 1966, with a study of how"

33720,"== Terminology as theory == 

 Much of the article, and the comments here, are written as though there were a 'thing' which has the name 'infinitive'. Actually, linguistic terminology, like scientific terminology, arises from and is embedded in theories about language. English used to be described as if it were a language like Classical Latin or Greek; in this framework, an English 'infinitive' is whatever seems to be analogous to an infinitive in those languages. It's questionable whether 'infinitive' is a useful term at all in a truly stand-alone description of modern English. If it is, the case needs to be made purely in terms of modern English, and not by reference to other languages. 

 A similar argument applies to modern Greek. To call the form of the verb which is used after the auxiliary έχω (to form various tenses which didn't exist in classical Greek) an 'infinitive' is hard to justify by any definition. The form can't be used anywhere else, which is quite uncharacteristic of infinitives.

 What fanboy ordering? 
 If the N64 is included in a title this must be seperate to psx vs. saturn. The psx vs. saturn was a major event that the N64 had F.A to do with other then a few magazine articles wondering if the ultra 64 would upset the balance when it was released. The n64 had some minor competition with the psx though it had pretty much none with the saturn, it had more competitive cross over with the dreamcast then the saturn (though this was still minor). 
 Dreamcast: It failed to make a impact enough to start a console war. Its main advertising was blown before the ps2 was released and it was not long after its release that it was clear the dreamcast had failed. I don't think the dreamcast had any competition with the GC and xbox, it was gone before they came out. 

 Turbogrfx 16- WTF? The pc engine was not a contender, it was halfway between 8 bit and 16 bit, never released in Europe and only given a minor release in north America. It had moderate success in Japan though it did not take market share from the other two because of this. 

 Handhelds- None of the others are title worthy. The main contest was only between the gameboy and game gear. Lynx...I'm not too sure about it TBH though I know it was never a serious threat.

94377,"Logicus to Guettarda: Surely you are wrong yet again Guettarda, because the current article demonstrably gives an answer to this question, thus bringing that question firmly and even centrally within its scope. For the article clearly makes claims on the ‘’dating’’ and also ostensibly on the ‘’rationale’’ of the alleged Darwinian revolution. Thus it brings such issues as the rationality and rationale of scientific revolutions and the nature of scientific method very firmly and centrally within its scope, as indeed all histories of science do. For on the one hand it claims the theory that evolution is mainly caused by natural selection was not widely accepted until the 1930s (dating), but on the other hand also claims that Darwin presented compelling evidence for that theory (rationale). The remaining mystery this POV Wikipedia history of science therefore raises for any evidential theory of the logic of scientific revolutions and scientific method such as Wikipedia presents elsewhere in its articles is why it took at least some 80 years for Darwin’s theory to be widely accepted if the evidence Darwin presented for it was indeed compelling.  

 In conclusion, if questions like this really are outside the scope of this article as you and your Wiki pals may undemocratically elect to define the scope of Wiki history of science articles, then the article must surely relinquish (i.e. delete) making any claims on the dating and rationale of that alleged revolution as it currently does in order to achieve a NPOV on such issues.

 :This seems reasonable.  I think the fact remains that in the end the crew flew an airworthy aircraft into the sea.  Any first-year pilot knows when the stall warning goes off you push the stick forward, but the planes have gotten so complex, and non-autopilot handling of situations so rare, that they didn't have training to fall back on in this case... which is appropriate discussion in the article for the cause of the pilot error.  In addition (and I'm speaking as an amateur pilot and not from sources here), the fact that the right-hand pilot is the only one who knew he was giving nose-up input to the control stick was a contributing problem.

Headlines are often written by people other than the article's author for the purpose of attracting eyeballs, not communicating relevant information.

 The extremes of both the left and the right have hijacked Enoch Powell. The left use him (incorrectly, in my view) as a leader of the racist parts of our political system.

So the left want nothing except Powell's supposed racism to appear in any Wikipedia article about him, whilst the right also want Powell's views to be misrepresented, so that they appear to have a well-known politician espousing their views.

 If you do some proper research, rather than write aimless junk, you will find that Legia Warszawa are the most hated team in Poland because of their Communist roots. The Polish people suffered a lot during Communism as did many other Eastern European countries like Slovakia, Bulgaria and Czech Republic. 

 Polonia Warszawa are the oldest football club in Warszawa/Warsaw. They were also the first Polish football club to win the league after World War Two. However, the Communists wanted to destroy the club as Polonia fans were patriotic and the Polonia fans succeeded. 

 The Communists founded Legia Warszawa and, as well as controlling Legia, they succeeded in relegating Polonia Warszawa to the third division even though Polonia had won the title. 

 Yes, they may have fought Communism in the Eighties but you fail to mention about their Communist roots. Every club in Poland hates them due to this, especially Polonia as they suffered the most."

 Misconceptions 
 In a popular Bugs Bunny episode entitled """"Hillbilly Hare,"""" a square dance caller starts the dance with the following parody of square dance calling: 

 """"Bow to your corner, bow to your own.  
 Three hands up and 'round you go,  
 Break it up with a dosey-do.  
 Chicken in the bread pan kickin' out dough.""""  
 This animated satire has helped popularize the commonly held and mistaken notions that one should hold one's arms crossed over the chest while executing the step. 

 The crossed-arm do-si-do also may come from the fact that the early teachers of square dance and contra dance revival were recruited from the International Folk Dance movement, according to an article in the Old Time Herald.

459,"A few questions that need resolving regarding this article 

 1) Why the inclusion of the actions of individuals? Surely the point of corporate behaviour is that it is the action of a corporation in itself, although these actions may not always be the intended ourcome of any individuals involved. Furthermore whilst the effects of corporate behaviour on individuals may be a useful sociological side effect I do not see this as central to the issue of corporate behaviour. 

 2) I think an explicit division needs to be made between business/capitalist corporations and noncapitalist corporations (NGOs, charities etc) as I think the proposed rules of corporate behaviour can only be seen to apply to capitalist corporations. 

 If no-one disagrees with this would people like me to attempt these changes (removal of references to indiviudals, creation of distinction between business and non-business coporations)?

 :One of the theories, but hardly a proven fact. Read Idaho Falls for what I think is the definative public account. The operator who pulled the rod out too far, John Byrnes, was recently separated from his wife (crashing at friend's places for the last several nights) and had money problems. Byrnes was mostly at fault in the marital strife: he was a philanderer and drunk. 

 :Richard Legg's wife was a local Mormon girl, several months pregnant, and by all accounts hardly likely to be engaged in any kind of relationship with Byrnes. Most likely, they never met. Both the widows Legg and Byrnes have denied there were any extramarital affairs among them. 

 :The murder suicide rumor had swirled around the industry for years following the accident. It became a semi-official claim when a nuclear safety researcher repeated the rumor in a memo stressing the importance of making reactors operator-proof. Previous reactor safety guidelines always assumed the operators were in their right minds when at work, and instead concentrated on commies with grenade launchers. 

 :The most plausible reasoning I've read was Byrnes resented Legg because Legg was recently given a supervisory role. They had fought some months earlier at a bachelor's party (both men were drunk, and Byrnes had just fucked a whoreLegg probably taunted him about it). Byrnes had a temper, and had been known to throw shit around inside the reactor control room when frustrated. He was recently passed on the same supervisor job. The men were several hours behind in their night's task list. Legg probably said something to chide Byrnes (perhaps officiously restating the rule that the control rod mustn't be raised too far, or telling him to """"excersize it"""" to prevent sticking), and Byrnes just had a """"to hell with this"""" moment and raised the rod too far to piss everybody else off. Kaboom.

 Hi MalleusMaleficarum1486, after seeing what  wrote and your follow-up comments, I am writing regarding the Wikipedia WP:CIVILITY pillar in my capacity as an administrator on Wikipedia.  The essence of civility is maintaining respect for the people you're interacting with on Wikipedia, even if you disagree with their views.  This can be tough to do, believe me I know, especially if you really don't respect their views:  it's easy to think, 'You hold an idiotic view therefore you must be an idiot too.'   

 I also know that on Wikipedia it's easy to get away with hurling insults in someone's direction by insulting their actions or views instead of the person.  You can't say 'You're an idiot and a jerk' but saying 'You write idiotic things a jerk would write' gets you through an WP:NPA loophole.  However doing that doesn't meet with the core civility principle of maintaining respect, so please don't do it.  If you do it, whatever message you were trying to get across will be totally lost, and if your goal was really to try to convince someone of something, you will have failed. 

 Please contact me on my User Talk if you have any questions.   """

It says a lot about each of us responsible wikipedians as well, because I have learned from you and everyone else a lot of things about life and about writing just by reading wikipedia articles.  

 Well, about the world champion boxers, its just that I was an amateur boxer myself when I was 12-14. I didnt make it, and let me assure you for everyone that wins a world title, there are , well not 1,500, but I can tell you none of the twenty five guys that trained at my gym ,and these included two world ranked boxers, became a world champion, thats why I feel that the status world champion is a special one so thus should be put next to the boxer's name, just like Presidents are not merely mentioned as politicians next to their names.  

 I'd guess the ratio is about 500/1 to 800/1 as far as the kids who fight as amateurs and those who go on to become professional world champions.  

 BUT, I'd hate a revert war and furthermore, I'd hate to have you an enemy, as a mater of a fact I mean to become friends with everyone here if possible. So Im not gonna put world champion again unless for some reason I forget.

63236,"Ein gutes Beispiel dafür, wie kreativ hochklassig und inhaltlich wertvoll man heutzutage im HipHop immer noch agieren kann, liefert Özgür Youssuf  ab. Es muss in den Texten ja nicht immer um Sex, Geld und fette Autos gehen. Was ja auch ganz lustig sein kann, aber hier gibt es eine Message, eine tiefergehende Bedeutung. Der seit einigen Jahren in Wien lebende und aus Afghanistan stammende Rapper hat etwas zu sagen. Er will aufwecken, die Sinne schärfen und das vorurteilsbehaftete Bild, welches die Leute hierzulande den Menschen seines Heimatlandes entgegenbringen, revidieren und auf die Missstände in seinem Heimatland aufmerksam machen. 

 Es muss für Özgür Youssuf wohl vorgekommen sein, als würde er auf einem anderen Planeten landen, als er einst vor wenigen Jahren in Österreich angekommen ist. In seinem Geburtsland Afghanistan als Angehörigen der usbekischen Minderheit waren ihm und seiner Familie viele Rechte, die in unseren Graden als selbstverständlich erachtet werden, verwehrt geblieben. Obwohl hervorragend ausgebildet (er studierte an der Universität Balkh Rechtwissenschaften) und fünf Sprachen fließend sprechend (Arabisch, Russisch, Englisch, Farsi /Dari, Urdu, Pashtu), blieben ihm als Teil der ausgegrenzten Volksgruppe kaum Chancen, zu einem, seinen Fähigkeiten entsprechenden Job zu gelangen. Was in einem krisengeschüttelten und kriegsgebeutelten Land wie Afghanistan, auch für die Vertreter der Mehrheitsbevölkerung ohnehin auch schon schwer genug ist. 
 
 Dennoch, trotz aller Missstände, trotz all den vielen Ungerechtigkeiten und Grausamkeiten, die ihm in seinem noch jungen Leben widerfahren sind, hat Özgür Youssuf sich seine Liebe zu seinem Heimatland bis heute bewahrt. Sich selber als „Kämpfer“ für die gute Sache und die friedliche Verständigung zwischen den einzelnen Volksgruppen, sehend, hat er in Wien den Rapp für sich als die perfekte künstlerische Ausdrucksform entdeckt. Seit Jahren nun schon höchst sich aktiv in der Szene bewegend, ist es Özgür Youssuf vor allem ein Anliegen, die Leute auf die schwierigen Verhältnisse in Afghanistan aufmerksam zu machen. Auch will er den vielen ungerechtfertigten und nicht hinterfragten Vorurteilen, welche man in der westlichen Hemisphäre den Menschen des zentralasiatischen Landes entgegenbringt, offensiv entgegentreten. „Afghane sein, ist nicht gleich Terrorist oder Taliban. Wir sind mehr und wir können mehr“, so der im Jahre 1986 geborene Rapper. 
    
 Bislang in Erscheinung getreten ist Özgür Youssuf mit zwei selbst produzierten Alben „Nasibe mor“ (2006) und „Fuck The Police“ (2009). Auch ist er recht fleißig auf den Bühnen von hier bis nach Afghanistan unterwegs, um seine Message an die Leute zu bringen. Rapp bedeutet für den 26 Jährigen jene Freiheit, das sagen zu können, was man will und für richtig befindet. Und das tut Özgür Youssuf heute mit allem Nachdruck"

We put AeroPress coffee makers made with this new grade of polycarbonate through our tests and they too withstood the tests as well as hundreds of uses with no detectable degradation, just like AeroPresses made of the regular grade of polycarbonate. The new grade of polycarbonate is over twice as expensive as the conventional grade.

 I normally respect many of your views BrownHairedGirl when it comes to categories, but in this case (and with the other """"anti-X"""" cats.) you and the other ballot-stuffers are dead wrong. Wassermann  

 I have replied on the CfD discussion, and I'd be delighted to see a substantive response to my more detailed explanation of the problems I perceive with the category.  However, the reason I am leaving a message here is that you have made a serious allegation, viz that I am engaged in ballot-stuffing: I would be grateful if you would either substantiate that allegation or withdraw it.   •   

 :I do indeed apologize, because reading back over that comment I do certainly seem quite harsh  I can be kind of mouthy (typy?) sometimes...sorry about that!  I was referring to how editors totally uninvolved with those particular categories basically just went down the list and wrote """"Delete"""" three times in a row, not even thinking twice (or three times) about it, not even caring because they know nothing of the topic(s). However, I now notice that you all seem to be the people that regularly 'vote' on most category related issues, so I suppose that you all do certainly have a certain degree of authority/expertise when it comes to categories in general. Again, it was indeed a rude comment and I am sorry about it, though to be truthful I did sense a great deal of groupthink going on there at that time (i.e., no one offered any actual REASONS for deletion besides """"per nom""""). I actually sort-of shot myself in the foot right afterwards though because I then went straight down that list of nominated categories and added """"Strong keep"""" three times in a row just like you all had added """"Delete"""" three (or more) times that day, all to the same lists, all the same people, all in a row (this is what I meant by ballot stuffing, not 'sockpuppets' or anything like that). I don't know though  I still don't understand all of the features and protocol of Wikipedia so I can seem pretty lost sometimes, so please excuse my general ineptness around here. I'll do my best to tone down my sometimes smoldering rhetoric in the future though before I go mouthing (typing) off again; I also made a few snide remarks about trivialities such as spelling at the same time that I now regret, so if that person is reading this I apologize to them too.

 The article has been revamped completely and it has improved on readability; It is now more accessible. 
 However the way the article has been revamped is trying to make a huge point, and that point is Awfully wrong; And it is that the Holy Spirit is an elaboration introduced in the New Testament only as opposed to a Divine Person who was revealing Himself and was being revealed by The Father and the Divine Wisdom to the entire creation: 
 
 - This Divine revelation is recorded in the Old Testament, including books that are considered canonical for the Judaism and Christianity alike. 
 - The References to the Ruach Hakodesh in the old Testament are understood within the Christendom as references made to the Holy Spirit of Christ Who is the Holy Spirit of the Father. The reference provided for the affirmation that the term """"Holy Spirit"""" only appears thrice (Acts and Pauline writings by Watson E. Mills) denies the official interpretation of Ruach Hakodesh within major Catholic faiths as recorded in prominent theological works and the Roman Catholic Cathechism. 

  
 therefore: 

 - The article is summarized in the lead naming Synoptic gospels, Pauline and Johannine Works as the only basis for the validity of """"the idea"""" of the Holy Spirit as a Divine Person and so is the biblical references section expanded. So the article presents the reader with the idea of no Biblical references for the Spirit of God in the old Testament, and that is wrong; That one is a line of thinking commonly found on detractors. 

 - Biblical references for the Holy Spirit abound in the old Testament: In Genesis, in Proverbs, in Psalms, also as of special note there is the Book Of Wisdom, that is considered canonical for most Christians and is a treaty on the Most Holy Trinity. 
 
 - From those references and from many others The Church identifies God the Father as being The All-Mighty, the Divine Wisdom as being God the Son, and the breath of God, The Spirit of God as being the Holy Spirit of the Father and the Son.]"""

 ::Yes, ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 do have different check digit calculations; in particular, ISBN-10 was devised in pre-barcode days, and uses a calculation involving modulo 11, so when this yields the final value 10, this is shown as """"X"""". ISBN-13 on the other hand was devised to be compatible with the EAN-13 barcode (which recognises ten unique symbols, with no provision for the letter X), and consequently uses the same check digit calculation as is used to produce the barcode on your cornflakes box. In my experience, whenever I've come across a book with both ISBN-10 and ISBN-13, the check digits rarely match (sometimes they do: ISBN 0-319-22897-5 and ISBN 978-0-319-22897-5).

 == [citation needed] == 

 I had read somewhere that essentially many people that didn't have positive interactions with their caregivers in early childhood, only negative ones (heavy beatings could be one) become sadists and/or masochists. They have no choice but to love such parent(s) (they have no other options, unless this is a commune) so they confuse hurting with helping and get effed up arousal/romance styles. Like knives/electricity/burning/hanging/mutilation/crotch attacks/feces eating/slavery/butt fucking till the anus bleeds, or, in milder cases, lower amounts of suffering. (spectrum between normal romantic/sex relationships and inability to form them) This almost makes too much sense to need citation but (typical of """"people sciences"""") Googling """"causes of masochism"""" shows only hypotheses and this is not one of them. However, there are citations for at least 30% of child abuse victims abusing their children and masochists outnumbering sadists. And some sadists probably want to abuse their children but don't cause consenting masochists won't get them in trouble. I hypothesize that the relatively small S&M; research community's laissez faire-ness and inability to feel that Orwellian reversal of the injury-prevention drive of self preservation is perverse causes it to not think of this. Also the Google hits are all copied from what appears to be the DSM. Psychiatrists are often cold people who analyse humans like objects and many S&Ms; say giving pain is love (again the good is bad, bad is good Newspeak thing again) so a love-based theory is not really in their personality toolkit. 

 (Psychiatry is also almost the study of fucked up-ness (a guy who's vertical 24/7 — thinks he's a spillable glass of juice, afraid of people drinking him, lol) they must be jaded to effed up ppl..)  

 Anyway, the DSM hypotheses seem wishy-washy to me compared to the one I support (Freud's ones usually do too, and look how those turned out). Shouldn't there be a version of Occam's Razor that says that the social sciences theory that seems least mushy to non-wishy washy doctorates is most likely to be correct? 

 If I was misinterpreted, my main point was that I don't want to experience an intercourse that's more pleasurable than regular intercourse. I want to retain the ability to have intercourse with different kinds of people without it being second-best, not just the kinkier than average. 

 Also, I'm aware that women have different thresholds where pain starts and anus tightnesses and it doesn't hurt some. And that some female prostates are more sensitive than others. I'd still be concerned if she's 5'0"""" and being/practically demanding me to """"pound my ass faster!"""". I'm now reminded that I generally fantasized anal sex with adult girls in 5th grade because I thought it was fairer. You know, a penis size to anus width thing. Peer girls were hotter, I imagined them with unusually loose anuses.   """

 First off, I'm sorry for the inconvenience this has caused you. The block in question was slated to expire in about two or three hours from the time of this reply, but I've lifted it in any case  if nothing else, the symbology of doing so is important. 

 If it's any consolation, I was not """"drunk with power,"""" but was struggling to deal with a very persistent and abusive user who was stalking valuable editors and vandalizing a wide number of articles (more than could be practically protected from editing, another available tool). I've been a user at Wikipedia for some time, and an administrator for several months, but this is the first time I've dealt with these particular issues on such a scale or intensity. Seemingly credible death and rape threats were being issued not only against a particular user, but also against their family members. The only apparently viable options were for the victim user to stop editing Wikipedia, or for a strong action to deter the troll from further abuse. 

 Before you ask, I did check, and Sympatico is not apparently known for their responsiveness to abuse reports. Very few ISPs are; that's unfortunate for situations such as this, because it might be the best way to actually deal with these sorts of problems. 

 In any case, I tried a brief rangeblock, at first. The block was set only to block anonymous users, and included simple instructions to register an account an evade the block. When that didn't work, I opted to try a longer one, three days, which is what you ran into. 

 It's difficult to know ahead of time how much collateral damage such a block will cause. I truly do hate to think that even one person will have to suffer for the unfortunate actions of one abusive user, and in this case the damage was more than I was willing to tolerate. I've lifted the block, and will strive to avoid such actions in the future. 

 Unlike the apparently faceless admins at many sites, I've found that most enwiki admins are responsive to queries and really do care what their """"customers"""" think. In my case, I'm only human; I have troubles, I get busy or overwhelmed. I do the best I can, but it is inevitable that any person will make mistakes. Chalk it down as a lesson learned. 

 The block should be removed at this time; if you have any problems editing, feel free to contact me or the unblock-en-l mailing list (you'll see instructions for doing so in the event you're blocked). 

 Thanks for your time and consideration.  """

(2) """"Jesus started out as a myth with historical trappings added later""""—well, all this means is that Jesus was a mythological character created by the Christians, and as time went by, they tried to make him look more historical. Doesn't conflict with #1, and I thought this was a position adopted by some of the people discussed in this article—for instance, Paul conceives of Jesus as entirely a supernatural, spiritual being, and it's only in the Gospels that there are attempts to make him a person who appeared in a definite time and place. (3) """"Jesus was historical but lived c100 BCE""""—this isn't the historical Jesus, this is a different guy. On any standard reconstruction the historical Jesus lives in the first third of the 1st century CE (unless you think he outlived the crucifixion or something). Note that in the reference Bruce gives, p. 65 of Price's contribution to The Historical Jesus: Five Views, Price names both """"the early G. A. Wells"""" and Alvar Ellegard as authors who hold this view. Wells has clearly stated that in his early work he denied that there was a historical Jesus, so this position is clearly not in conflict with the idea that there was no historical Jesus. The basic idea is """"the New Testament is not based on the life of the historical Jesus, but a different person who lived in a much earlier time."""" (4) """"The Gospel Jesus is in essence a composite character and therefore non historical by definition."""" Ok, well, this doesn't conflict with the idea that there was no historical Jesus either, does it? The source Bruce gives for this view is Robert M. Price, so this point blends in with (5) There is not enough to show Jesus existed (Jesus Agnosticism), of which Price is an example. I don't think this fully represents what Boyd/Eddy are saying, because they lump this in with the non-historical position of Bauer, Drews, and Wells—the difference with Price is that he says it's more likely that there was no historical Jesus; he is, in other words, still very much in the CMT camp, but he's using the language of probability rather than certainty. (6) the gospel Jesus didn't exist. Bruce gives Doherty as a source for this, but unless I've misunderstood what Doherty has written on his website about his advocacy of """"the non-existence of an historical Jesus of Nazareth"""", his position is not best summed up as """"the gospel Jesus didn't exist."""" Rather, it's, well, """"Jesus was an entirely fictional or mythological character..."""" And sure, there's probably more to what Doherty says, but he shares common ground with the other authors covered in this article, in that they all argue that the historical Jesus didn't exist (or, if you want, that it's more likely than not that he didn't exist). 

 Just to be clear, I think that the lead, and perhaps many sections of the article, don't do a great job of explaining the CMT to the reader. Bruce has raised some matters that need to be more clearly covered in the article. But the bullet points in his post above don't provide support for altering the basic definition of the article. 

 Also, we have so many sources that say that Drews argued there was no historical Jesus (even Weaver, whom Bruce mentions, said that """"Drews would become the most notorious spokesman for the deniers of Jesus' historicity"""" (p. 49), that we shouldn't soften this characterization based on an editor's reading of Drews himself.

You say you find my analysis false, yet you ignore what I've said.  Where is the accusation explained in your version?  It isn't.  Your version says that Wilson interrupted the speech with a comment.  My version says he interrupted the speech with an accusation.  I'm not committed to """"calling him a liar"""", as that can be further refined in several ways; For example, one could say that Wilson """"accused Obama of lying"""", etc.  But simpy blurting out """"You lie!"""" doesn't tell the reader anything important, and as I've argued above, cheats the reader out of important information.  Wilson isn't actually known for his comments, which is why the quote isn't important.  If he said something notable or unique, or even strange or informative, then yes, we would keep the quote.  But that's not the case here.  Wilson is known for calling the President a liar.  This idea that the statement """"You lie!"""" is somehow notable, appears to be a Republican talking point, not a fact.  Most people know Wilson for simply making an accusation, not for those two words, and the reliable sources make this very clear.  The existence of You Lie! shows that there is an effort by some to glamorize those two words, and your edit appears to further their cause.    Wilson called the president a liar, or Wilson accused the president of lying - either one is acceptable.  But simply saying he interrupted the speech with """"You Lie"""" misses the mark and robs the reader of the broader context.  We need to write articles for people who know nothing about the topic.  If someone was to read the current version, that Wilson interrupted Obama's speech with """"You lie"""", what exactly would that mean to them?  Ask yourself that.  To me, it is extremely poor writing, and fails to mention what actually happened.  Those two words are not notable.  What is notable is Wilson's accusation and the fact that he called the president a liar.  The lead needs to state that fact in unambiguous terms.    """

14175,"""unknown person, and confirmation was given when investigations revealed the paint itself to be different to the paint used for the rest of the picture.     

 The original painting shows a dark background with Leonardo’s face highlighted in the centre of the composition, but the bright splash of a contrasting white feather at top left reduces the impact of his face and radically changes his intended motive.   Leonardo would be insulted if graffiti was exhibited as his work, and taking all this into account, the painting is presented here with the feather removed to help appreciation of the work. 

 Appreciation of the painting involves understanding a technique used to make it seem more life-like.    So far as we know, this technique is a Leonardo invention to make the viewer feel kissed, and has not been used anywhere else, before or since. 

 Leonardo specialised in communicating with a person’s subconscious so he would feel moved without knowing why, and in this case he has added a second ghostly face at a slightly smaller scale directly below the primary face, but this ghost is facing the opposite way, and ‘invisible’ when viewed from the front in the ordinary way. 

 If the painting is viewed from a narrow angle, both mages are condensed along their horizontal axis so that it seems there is the beginning of two faces looking in different directions – but as the angle increases, the bottom face quickly dissolves while the top face resolves into the proper image, giving the impression of movement and life to an image with evocative lips pursed to suggest the invitation of a kiss. 

 To cause the painting to be viewed at a narrow angle without disclosing any reason, Leonardo has written a piece of mysterious script, his “signature”, on the back of the panel where the viewer would be likely to look more than once to resolve the riddle.  

 The script;  PINXIT – MEA  is written in Leonardo’s right to left writing, and its ironic? meaning is unsettled as yet because complicated issues of gender are raised.                       
 It suggests a woman saying ‘my picture’. – a mood-setting riddle perhaps? 

 In this way Leonardo has made his self-portrait seem alive because it moves the viewer to interact by turning the painting to examine the signature on its back, which, as it returns to position, leaves a subconscious impression that Leonardo is kissing the beholder.  

 Given the mutilating marks across the blue eyes, we can speculate that someone was maddened by the recurring tension of the kiss juxtaposed with his cool gaze every time the signature was checked, and that this feeling has provoked them into attacking something they didn’t understand. 

 ;RESULTS OF TESTS 
 In 2009 the study of the newly-discovered painting was assigned to a team of scholars who carried out an extensive series of investigations aimed at recognition of the dating of the painting and allocation to the hand of Leonardo.   Team leaders were; INNOVA, CIRCE, University of Naples, Cybernetics - National Research Council, and University Suor Orsola Benincasa.  

 Prof. Gaetano Di Pasquale of the University of Naples identified the wood body of the painting as Populus, present in all Italian regions, and  Radiocarbon dating tests of three fragments gave a range of 1474 to 1517.  

 Raman analysis by Prof. Carlo Camerlingo and Prof. Antonio Sasso of the University of Naples was impossible because of a layer of varnish, and MMS Magnetic scanning at very high 100 microns resolution was carried out by Dr Hector Sarno  of  INNOVA to check for illegible letters and to compose a magnetic map of the painting.  
       
 Analysis by X-ray fluorescence by Prof. Giorgio Trojsi Suor Orsola Benincasa University and Prof. John Paternoster of the Department of Physics, University of Naples showed that the feather was painted in a titanium-based pigment not used in other parts of the painting.    

 Forensic graphology specialist Prof. Silvana Iuliano of the University of Urbino found that the characters on the door are represented in an alphabet conceived by Leonardo in the Atlantic Codex, with the writing and the ink being contemporary to those used and recognized in the writings of Leonardo. 

 Prof Felice Festa of the University of Chieti, together with collaborators, made comparative computer analysis of facial soft tissue on the most famous portraits of Leonardo in order to determine the correct facial features. Among the many portraits available, only five, including Francesco Melzi’s chalk drawing, believed to be true by the scientific community, were taken into account along with the face of the Vitruvian Man, The Lucan self-portrait, and the face found in """"Codex on the Flight of Birds”.

Those from Northern Ireland have the exact entitlement to Irish Citizenship as those born in any other part of Ireland."""" 

 This was true under the pre-1999 laws, however now the key question as to whether one is a 'full' Irish citizen at birth or just 'entitled' to be an Irish citizen is based not on whether one is born in the ROI or Northern Ireland, but on whether one has another citizenship at birth.    

 Most people born in Northern Ireland do have another citizenship (British) but the law applies equally to those born in the Republic of Ireland who acquire British or another citizenship (by descent) at the time of birth.    It's a grey area if the 'other' citizenship requires registration, in the case of Australia, for example. 

 All that said, the distinction between someone who is 'entitled' to be an Irish citizen and an Irish citizen proper is a grey area.    It is unlikely that it will be tested in the Irish courts, however it may become an issue in a foreign court (if entitlement to citizenship of another country depends on not having Irish citizenship).    One one construction, the distiction is merely a political statement that certain Irish citizens will not be treated as having that citizenship unless they wish to.

6975,"== Key coloration == 

 I think this section needs amendment.  

 Pythagorean tuning is a bad example for a tuning with key coloring, meantone tunings would be equally bad examples. When we look at the interval structure of those keys, we notice that all keys used in the historical periods related to those tunings had exactly same interval structure in each of the keys. The drawback to this uniformity is the presence of wolf tones, which prevent one from modulating around the whole circle of fifths. Thus, the fact that renaissance keyboards had twelve keys to an octave does not imply that the chain of fifths was viewed as a circle. 
 The two ways to accommodate for these wolf tones were simply retuning the instrument, or far less commonly, instruments with split black keys, one producing the flat note, another the respective sharp note. 

 The 18th century solution to this, was using microtonal variations of the same interval in a way that eliminated wolf tones. The side effect of this microtonal variation was that each key sounded a bit different. That is my understanding of what key coloration usually means. Equal temperament is a later invention that allows modulation around the whole circle of fifths without any key coloration. 

 My position is that even though wolf tones are here cited as examples of key coloration, they are applicable to that purpose only from the viewpoint of modern music, in a somewhat rebellious spirit. They are however not examples of key coloration in the theoretically more conservative sense of the word."

 == Ti == 

 Hi , I thought I'd drop a few notes on your talk page with some help on writing articles o) 

 First of all, it may be best for you to do a bit of reading, staring with the Wikipedia manual of style, which will give you a lot of information about how Wikipedia prefers its articles to follow.  It's not as hard to follow as it might look; quite a bit of the information there probably won't be vital for you at first. 

 Second, I recommend you make a user sandbox - which is just an area you can use to practise in, and to make notes in, and to get things ready in.  If you click this red link: , that will let you create that page (it gives you an edit window to start work in).  Anything, anywhere, on the help and information pages which gives you an example, try it out in your sandbox until you're familiar with it. 

 For your article, the next thing you want to do is start collecting as much information as you can about it.  Google searches (particularly in Books and Scholar) will be your best friend for this!  Once you've found the information, the next most important thing is to start writing up each fact in your own words (very important, this), and make a note at the same time of exactly where that information came from.  Build in the references as you go along; I'm going to copy in, down below this, a whole heap of help on doing references, which was produced by one of our best teachers (). 

 Here's another place that you'll find incredibly useful - citation templates which you can copy and paste into your sandbox, between  tags; you just fill in the blanks from your sources into the template, and you'll end up with nicely formatted citations o)  It all helps.  Remember to add a references section to your sandbox (make a new line, and put ==References== on it, and type {{reflist}} on the next line, so that you can see how your citations look as you do them.  Remember to save your page often! You don't want to lose your work. 

 Hopefully this will give you a good start and make life easier for you.   …  
 ==How references work== 

 === Simple references === 

 These require two parts; 

 :a) 

 Chzz is 98 years old. """"The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009.  

 He likes tea.  [http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com Tea website]  

  
 :b) A section called """"References"""" with the special code """"{{reflist}}""""; 

 == References == 
 {{reflist}} 

  
 (an existing article is likely to already have one of these sections) 

 To see the result of that, please look at . Edit it, and check the code; perhaps make a test page of your own, such as  and try it out. 

 === Named references === 

  
 Chzz was born in 1837.  
 """"The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009.  
 

 Chzz lives in Footown. 

  

 Note that the second usage has a / (and no closing ref tag). This needs a reference section as above; please see  to see the result. 

 === Citation templates === 

 You can put anything you like between  and , but using citation templates makes for a neat, consistent look; 

  
 Chzz has 37 Olympic medals.  {{Citation 
  | last = Smith 
  | first = John 
  | title = Olympic medal winners of the 20th century 
  | publication-date = 2001 
  | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] 
  | page = 125 
  | isbn = 0-521-37169-4 
 }} 

  

 Please see  to see the result. 

 For more help and tips on that subject, see ."""

I know Liverpool fans who are Catholic and Protestant...similarly I know Everton fans who are Catholic and Protestant too. Lets not give any attention to the people who attempted to divide merseyside football supporters by religion and concentrate on the facts...Everton was formed from a church and Liverpool was formed from the people in Everton who wanted to stay at Anfield.

The particular gripe I have is that the article now says """"on the assumption that those behaviours were responsible for their results.""""  That's not entirely accurate, but I understand why you wanted to say it that way, to frame it as a 'claim'.  In one instance their methodology included interviewing hundreds of people about their behaviors and mental processes when they got over a phobia, and then what made it into the phobia model were only those behaviors universally consistent among the majority of interviewees - idiosyncrasies were removed.  Then they tested by teaching the model to people, and if a person could get the same or similar results as the person or people it was modeled from, then it was said to be successful.  It was not simply based on assumption.  I suppose therein lies the claim - are these models actually as successful as they say they are?  If there are any studies confirming or refuting the efficacy of something such as, say, the phobia cure, then I suppose that could be referenced or included.

24248,""" If you're going to include a list of sources which back up your claim, it helps if they're not bogus in the first place (nat rev, biz insider, etc). Most of those (and in article body) are about Zoltan, penned by transhumanists, in T+ publications, or simple mentions; Wikipedia doesn't do mentions - only in-depth coverage which directly addresses the subject. While you may not need their personal consensus, a rough general consensus based upon policy or broader community consensus is required. The fundamental issue is source selection being garbage; either from a want of confirmation bias, or from a basic lack of broad coverage in high-quality sources. Generally community consensus has been parties need to be registered, recognized by some entity with a supervisory roll in such matters, and to have gained ballot access in an election at bare minimum. The party has no HQ, no FEC filing, no registration (other than an intent notice), no board, no treasurers, no delegates, nothing. Additionally, there is no indication this """"party"""" has autonomy or independence apart from Zoltan.  

 Another problem is instead of addressing concerns, editors continue to try and shoehorn content from rejected articles elsewhere as a backdoor method to undermine the editorial process. The solution is to solve it at the source, not in places like this. T+ Party content shouldn't be in this article at all; it should be on Zoltan's page where it belongs right now until someone decides to actually rewrite the draft from scratch. In this article, it deserves a passing blurb w/ MAIN redir to Zoltan at best.

I hope you will work with me to bring Netoholic around to our side of the table on this one  you know, he was here only six months ago  check it out  and perhaps with a little encouragement, he might come back.  

 But for now, our inflexible policy is to tag all templates right on their bodies. No exception is made for templates that are highly visible. Indeed, it could be argued that in such cases, it is even more vital to be sure that the largest number of users become aware that the nominated template is, indeed, up for deletion.  

 Please do not remove the prescribed tag from the nominated template until a decision has been made to retain the template. Thank you. —  09:18, 2005 Apr 7 (UTC)

 ::I have come to believe that {tfd} is entirely unnecessary and a menace to the project. I have not recently tried to alter the TfD process itself  as you have done  without the consent of others. I have merely nominated for deletion a template which I find is useless, dangerous, unattractive, and boring.  

 ::How big is this fight to you? You have attempted to reopen debate on {divbox}. Shall the matter be permitted to fester indefinitely? We have a policy and a workflow, and thus far, it has not been subject to edit war or seriously rude debate. Thus far, discussion has revolved around the proper place for, and for that matter, need for, {tfd}  the tag itself, not the process. And the debate over {divbox}, while not harmonious, ended without anybody screaming at anybody else that {divbox} was the anti-Christ, or its nomination for deletion equivalent to genocide.  

 ::Seven days is as long as a template is allowed to sit and stew; after that time, it is free to go peacefully. Do you want to call that into question, too?  

 ::As for tagging Template:Tfd, I'm sorry: {tfd} is not above the law. It is a template like any other, subject to all the same rules and the same level of scrutiny. You don't like what happens when it is tagged for deletion? Sweat it out like every other poor bastard with a dog in the fight. With any luck, a sudden surge of support for its deletion will not come in at the last minute, and you can then correctly remove the tag from the template, archive the discussion, and breath freely for another month.  

 ::Proposing Wikipedia:Votes for deletion itself for deletion is not relevant, or even illustrative. The action of nominating Template:Tfd for deletion does not call into question the page, Wikipedia:Templates for deletion. I think it's obvious that they are two separate and independent pages. Nor does the process of TfD depend inevitably on the tag {tfd}. For one, I have offered a new tag, , which is far more suitable for our purposes, as well as more attractive; for two, I am hardly convinced any tag at all is desireable; I am now leaning toward direct notification.  

 ::I despise threats, and I do not begin with you. Please allow me to believe I have given you sufficient notice that I view your recent actions in the harshest light. Despite all appearances of solidity, Wikipedia is a tiny, fragile ship afloat on a raging sea of chaos. We do not need to begin to violate policy simultaneously with editing that policy. It would take only a small number of sufficiently angry users to drag this project to a screeching halt. This is not a threat of mine whatever; but something I fear the subhumans will do if you  and I  give them sufficient cause to believe that the rule of common sense in harness with customary procedure no longer holds.  

 ::To risk annoying you with repetition, I am not threatening you: I will do such-and-such if you keep fooling with the way things are done. I am sharing my fears that if we persist in slugging it out, then our fight  together with the dozen similar feuds raging in one corner or another of this project's infrastructure  will eventually corrode and bring down the entire project upon our heads.  

 ::Let it be. I'll bet Netoholic will, too, if you do. He's too smart to go that far out on a limb. Let {divbox} go; and when its seven days have expired, I shall allow {tfd} its freedom, too.

It will state side effects of the treatment and how the treatment specifically targets the problem areas. It will also look at future research, such as the idea that the circuitry model will guide treatment development of deficits in attentional control, and the use of fMRI and electrophysiological recording techniques will increase."

 This present English WP article entitled Chūgi 籌木 derives from the Japanese 籌木 interwiki. I compiled Japanese synonyms given there and Chinese synonyms given in the 厕筹 interwiki, and searched for these """"shit stick"""" words in Google Books. The most commonly occurring Chinese and Japanese """"exact words"""" are: 
 *""""乾屎橛"""" 24,800 
 *""""籌木"""" 13,800 
 *""""屎橛"""" 5,920 
 *""""糞箆"""" 418 
 *""""廁籌"""" 280 
 *""""廁簡"""" 239 
 However, none of these occur with their pronunciations (e.g., kanshiketsu """"乾屎橛"""") in Google Books. D'oh! 

 These exact phrases with pronunciations do occur in full Google Web search, but see WP:GOOG. For instance, 333 occurrences of chūgi """"籌木"""", many (8 of first 10) copied from this article into WP mirrors and blogs/tweets; and 51 occurrences of kanshiketsu """"乾屎橛"""", many The Gateless Gate'' kōan references and Buddhist dictionaries.  

 The Digital Dictionary of Buddhism has two entries 
 *乾屎橛 (pr. gānshǐjué, kanshiketsu, etc.) shit stick (used for toilet paper; or Chan term of abuse from Gateless Gate kōan) 
 *籌 (pr. chóu, chū, etc.) small stake or stick (used for counting, voting, calculating, i.e., salaka [Sanskrit: Śalākā, Pali: salākā, etc.] """"stick""""; or for toilet paper)

 ::I can't see anything aleatory about the Books' style either.  They use a lot of samples in their music, and there is always a chance element when working with processing and such (i.e. you don't really know how the clip is going to sound when you reverse it, until you've done it).  This isn't aleatory though.  I guess it would be closer to musique concrète.  In any case, I don't think that the Books belong here.  (This is a slightly different topic, but I think that the distinction between Boulez and Cage on this page is unclear.  Cage didn't use the term aleatory, as far as I know, and their conflict had to do with intention vs. nonintention.  Perhaps a more neutral, technical definition, not immediately connected with a composer could start the music section, followed by a brief list of a few composers and representative works, and a link to the longer article on aleatory music.

 In the synopsis of this film, it's noted that Hilly's pie had Hilly's human excrement baked into it. WRONG !!!............I just watched that film for the first time, last night on TV. Hilly baked her SPIT into the pie (NOT her excrement) as this Wikipedia synopsis states. In fact, I KNOW it was her spit (that went into the pie) because when the book was published, and the black women were reading it out loud, they were reading about that, and all of them started laughing uproariously.  Also, then Hilly went ahead and told Celia what she put into the pie, Hilly said """"You.....just.....ate.....my ......spit ! Now you are going to get my diseases.""""

 :While I think it can be commendable that Blackie wants to ensure a neutral and NPOV tone in this sensitive article, he has also demonstrated an obsession with placing his own spin and in seeing """"POV"""" even when it's not really there, and abruptly removing whole parts of sections of this article with no regard to their noteworthiness or context in the article.  

 :His stated position is that his own removals and his own wordings are much more important and descriptive of the subject than what he has removed, which he deemed as """"clutter"""". I feel that Blackie's arguments are usually based on reasoning such as wp:ilikeit, wp:idontlikeit, wp:otherstuff, and seems to be violating WP:OWN. And accusing others of what he himself has become guilty of. When editors note the reliable sources and pertinence of stuff that he has whole-saled removed, Blackie initiates a series of repetitive and endless talk page posts attempting to justify his over-reactive edits. No matter how many other users disagree, and no matter how many links to guidelines and policies are offered, Blackie insists his perspectives are correct and he becomes wp:disruptpointy. Blackie seems to interpret WP policy and editor conduct rules to suit his own justifications and continually responds to editors who disagree with him with posts of redundant justifications of his own invention.    

 :Taking elements of truth (that I even have agreed with in part), but then going bananas with it, and arguably edit-warring.

And using the front excuse of """"POV"""" after a while starts to wear thin.   There was NO valid excuse, as one example, in removing the matter of """"Ashton smiling"""" and the reaction of Baez and what was said, as that was reliably sourced and pertinent in the goings-on of the closing arguments.

 == Proposed change == 

 I have been making general observations regarding the article and expressing my opinion that it should be made more general, less technical, and focus exclusively on what global warming is, using wikilinks to other more detailed articles to address the role of the IPCC, various climatic models, and proposed corrective actions. This proposed lede was taken largely from the current article lede, just generalized and heavily trimmed. Is there any support among the editors for revising the article in the same manner?   

 Although the terms """"global warming"""" and """"global cooling"""" can be used to describe cyclic variations in global temperature, the term """"global warming"""" has been generally used since the mid-1970's to describe the current global warming event, which dates from the mid-1700's. Since the late 1800's, measured average global temperature has risen approximately 0.74°C(ref)NOAA Global Warming FAQ(/ref), and further warming is predicted by reputable scientific organizations including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.  

 Predicted impacts of global warming include: rising sea levels; changes in the amount and pattern of precipitation; an expansion of subtropical deserts; the retreat of glaciers; permafrost and sea ice; more frequent occurrence of extreme weather events including heatwaves, droughts and heavy rainfall events; species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes; and changes in agricultural yields. 

 The current rise in global temperatures has been fairly rapid, and is attributed in large part to the presence of human-produced greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Although greenhouse gases can be produced by natural events (volcanos, for example), the vast majority of scientists believe that the additional human sources such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agricultural activity have created an imbalance in the global temperature-regulation system, and that corrective actions to reduce those human sources should be taken. 
     

 :I don't like it, and it contains several claims that are either wrong, irrelevant, or misleading. First, the initial hedge (""""can be used"""") adds no useful information. Secondly, global warming is overwhelmingly used not to refer to warming since the mid 1700s, but for the mostly anthropogenic warming in the 20th and 21st century. The 0.74 is since the late 19th century - it's easy to misread """"late 1800's"""" as 1800. I'm not really happy by the """"warming is predicted by organizations"""" - many individual scientists do so as well. """"permafrost and sea ice"""" are not a predicted impact (changes to them are). """"Fairly rapid"""" is a very weak statement - as far as we know, it's extremely rapid. Also, if it's current, it should be """"is"""", not """"has been"""". I like the """"attributed in large part"""", but we should mention the rapid increase in human-produced greenhouse gases, not just their presence (they have been present, to some degree or other, for 200000 years). The natural sources of GHGs are a red herring here - the increase is clearly anthropogenic, and only a very small fringe thinks otherwise. I'm not to happy about the """"imbalance in the global temperature-regulation system"""" - what would that system be?  Finally, I would clearly separate the corrective actions from the recognition of anthropogenic warming - you will probably find all combinations (""""human-caused, no action"""" (I think Lombog now falls into that group), """"human caused, action"""" (many there), """"not human-caused, no action"""" (strict deniers), and even """"not human caused, action anyways"""" (e.g. from people who are concerned about energy resources).

Except that じ and ぢ are both ji in Hepburn and therefore cannot be doubled. You need to use the kana not the romaji spelling of the kana to explain which kana can be used with the sokuon, because not all romaji systems transliterate all the kana the same.

 Sarah, I'm finding your approach to discussion on Ireland-related talk pages uncivil, unconstructive and abusive. Please stop bad-mouthing your fellow editors and obscuring discussion. Please try to engage in some real discussion with a mind to compromise, consensus and resolving disputes, not winning them. This not only relates to the current matter of whether """"country"""" should appear in the lead section, but across the board for your contributions, and has been a long-held opinion of mine and of others.   

 Sony; I find the approach of yourself, (and the 'other (3?)you refer to) - arrogant and dictatorial, applying one set of rules on POV, NPA, NPV to yourselves and another to those who disagree with you. The Ireland article is a classic - rather than address the points I have just made I get more insults. I find your  approach uncivil, nonconstructive and abusive. It seems to me that a small group on established editors regard themselves as the sole interpreters of ALL the Wiki rules and polices on just about everything.  
 Do you want me to go back, say two months, and produce a compendium of the things this group of """"yourself and some others"""" have said about me (and, btw, some very 'non'-consensus and non-polite and non-'assume good faith' things about other editors apart from myself).  

 You throw around accusations of 'abuse' while being abusive; you charge others with not seeking consensus while imposing your view and making up the rules to suit the article; you're latest charge (in a long string): """"Please stop bad-mouthing your fellow editors and obscuring discussion."""" 

 If you want examples of bad-mouthing: just read your own post above!!  

 Obscuring discussion? Far from it. I am opening up discussion where you wish to close off all avenues that don't lead to you 'winning'. This is NOT about winning. It is about reducing pov and bias from some Wiki Articles; especially the one titled """"Republic of Ireland"""", a bias which some editors apparently don't want to see.

 1) A living person who has a biographical entry on here can now have his biographers use his blog as a source?  That is questionable, please link to the official wiki policy stating that this is reasonable and or acceptable. I looked for it for a long time and never found it.  Why? Because Corrigan has repeatedly posted blog entries and REPEATEDLY deleted them and altered information later on in an attempt to control the information that has gone out about him.  I have personally archived previous entries that he later deleted (julienpdx.blogspot.com) , as has Elmysterio (elmysterio.blogspot.com).  We cannot however, be cited as sources according to the same principles since we are in the blogosphere or whatever the hell logic is being used here.  However, neither is Corrigan in this case right? 
 2) Corrigan posted a copy of his license online; he then states he used Photoshop to edit the image. STOP RIGHT THERE.  Regardless of WHY he used Photoshop on the image, the fact remains that Photoshop was used; thereby making the image a dishonest representation of truth and suspect, he stated he did this as well, but that was conveniently removed as a citation when it became obvious that the same logic used to defend it could also be used to attack it. 
 3) We all know that the age is under dispute and this whole BS about asking people to CITE the truth is ridiculous.  There isn't a way to do this unless blogs are cited and it isn't established whether or not this is ok 

 the fact is that some of us have bought the subsequent explanations and accepted them as truth and some of us have not.

 The Mt. Zion Male Voice Choir is the only choir of it's kind in Bermuda.  There is no other Bermudian choir that fuses secular type contemporary songs with traditional gospel to appeal to both Christians and non-Christian's without compromising the message.  Thousands of tourist over the years have been to Bermuda and witnessed this outdoor Ministry and many intentionally travel in July to catch one or all of the concerts.  This is known Island wide in Bermuda.  The choir has done a lot more things of significance than what I indicated in this article such as being the only local artist in Bermuda to ever have a song that charted at #1 on the Islands premiere gospel radio show """"The Gospel Train"""" on 105fm.  This was accomplished in 2 back-to back years in 2009 & 2010.  This is a ground breaking choir who has initiated several firsts for the Island.  Most recently was the release of the Concert/Documentary DVD release of """"Beyond The 4 Walls"""" which reveals much of what the choir has accomplished over the years.  This is the first release of it's kind in Bermuda from any local artist.  The only reason I was very brief in describing the history and accomplishments of this choir was because this site requires articles to support each point.  In Bermuda there is not as much choir news that has been published online than what is published in papers, announced on radio and local television.  This is a very popular and historic choir in Bermuda that is known and highly respected by many across North America.  This provides significant information on Bermudian heritage that should be available for research.

 In response to your edit here, I myself would support closing this case with a warning, if it were specific enough. There was a long interval of time during which Wispanow did not respond. Now that he has answered, it is evident that he does not understand the problem with his editing. You would be doing a favor for any future admins who may encounter this problem if you could warn Wispanow very specifically about the type of behavior that must not continue. One way to get the specifics would be another round of commentary at WP:AE, but that would be stressful and would take time. If I can provide any actual info from my own review of the case that might help, let me know. Otherwise, close the case in  whatever way you think best.  

 Wispanow is not a 'classic' Scientology edit warrior (i.e. pro or con Scientology), he has a rather eccentric viewpoint in which he considers that it's offending the national honor of Germany to report in our article some of the things that the government has done, or to report what reliable sources have had to say about German public opinion.  He doesn't seem to realize that it is POV editing for him to try to defend the national honor of Germany, since his complaints about 'racism' are merely his own personal opinion. Germany may not actually need such self-appointed defenders."

However, your calculations are incorrect since the logarithm is defined only for dimensionless quantities, so 'log(y Watts)' is meaningless. 
 :Here is the problem with explaining the decibel satisfactorily: any definition of the decibel based on its historical roots (instead of mathematical """"good practice"""") will remain troublesome.  A cleanup yields the following. 
 :: (a) Define B (bel) as a function such that x B =  for any positive number x.  Define d (deci) for any x by x d = x/10.  Define dB (decibel) by x dB = (x d)B, hence x dB = .  Example: 20 dB = 100. Similarly x B' =  and correspondingly dB' (example: 20 dB' = 10) for purposes shown next. 
 :: (b) Define dBW by x dBW = (x dB)W (example: 20 dBW = 100 W) and dBV by x dBV = (x dB')V (example: 20 dBV = 10 V).  Similarly, x dBW = ((x dB))W and so on.

Also be in mind that if they could demand the price (with the market) they were within their rights, but Elvis I think felt betrayed. Also, they were likely very busy and either didn't need Elvis or maybe even had trouble working him in even though he helped put them on the map. After the Jordanaires, Elvis used the gospel group The Imperials. His hero, Jake Hess had started the group, but his health made him have to quit before Elvis used them I believe. The Imperials also sang backup with Jimmy Dean and there came a time when both Jimmy and Elvis needed them and they couldn't do both.

 =Connexion of Montenegrin cap with Lovcen chapel= 

 Firstly chapel of Lovcen (build during prince Danilo) had shape of Montenegrin cap. It was badly damaged by thunderstorms and rain, so Prince Nicholas added bigger roof and lighting-conduct. He also  added HI initials on cap for the proclamation of Kingdom, as well as tried to give caps with green top to Muslim population (these caps are very rare). King banned wearing traditional costumes to citizens because they were too much expensive and made poverty to the people. 
 Chapel was bombed by the Austrians and Njegosh bones were transported to Cetinje. After Serbian occupation (or as they say """"liberation"""") Montenegrin flags that Serbians captured were attaint, Royal elm Tree (which grew near every royal palace in Europe, symbolized ruling dynasty) was chopped down, Ivan’s bell (gift from Skenderbey, symbolized Albanian - Montenegrin and Muslim - Orthodox friendship) was smelted down and from that metal Serbs made hasps from it. Also all Montenegrin symbols, including caps with HI were banned and cap with 4 oscyls were introduced. Montenegrin church was abolished in 1922 with decree of Alexander I. 
 The ruins of old chapel were totaly removed and new chapel was finished in 1927. And that's the only building built by Serbs (or Karadjordjevic dynasty). Only that new chapel had 2 circles in stead of originally one, symbolizing the unity. Also all caps had 4 oscyls. Even it was put on Kotor traditional cloathes! 
 Latterly Tito destroyed that chapel (basis were dug so Lovcen become 7m shorter than it really was before) and now it is believed that original basis do not exist at all. 
 In fact original caps had 5 curved golden lines, and caps for female had small flover. All rest caps, are (i'll use German word schund to describe it).  

 King Nicholas cap is the unique one. Well indeed there are 4 oscyls, ass seen on this page [] , but that was not on the top. Nichola had ambitions were to become King of united Serbia and Montenegro (during rule of Karadjordjevics in Serbia) or Duke of Montenegro in Serbian Kingdom (during rule of Obrenovics). He wanted to suceed his grandson but ... history was different and cruel.  
 Even perjanik guard (since Njegosh) had special design, with fleather. 
 However the popular one cap had strong connexions with the chapel.

 :Thanks for completing missing the point of dispute in this discussion, which has no longer has anything to do with the Pussy Riot reference. The issue was Hearfourmewesique's characterization of another editor, as my notification at 3O made explicitly clear (though apparently not explicitly enough for you). It is perfectly reasonable to discus that here, since this is where that behavior took place. If you wanted to move the discussion to another talk page, you could have. Or could've created a subheading. Instead, you decided to discuss a completely different topic, one that, while initially the topic of this section, has already been resolved. Bravo.

 this is wrong Holy Roman E....... 

 This spells of strong Serbian POV and is not true. 
 As Panonian pointed out Boka had a mix of both Croatian and Serbian towns. 
 The Croat ones eg Perast had 17 Catholic churches to only 2 Orthodix ones, the history books show that the people called themselves Croatian. Other towns had the same where people said they were Serbs or even Montenegrin.  
 So naturally both Croatian and Serbian historians claim the Boka region as their own as they have every right, the area is different town to town. Its very mixed so i think it would be best to leave ancient history out and just call us Montenegrin now as this now correct.  
 Today Montenegro has more links with Serbia as most Croats left.

 Change to the term 'Laser Tag' from 'lasertag', as it is still used extensively in the article, and seems to be the more popular name; there are over 10x as many references to Laser+Tag http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr;=&safe;=off&q;=%22laser+tag%22&btnG;=Search than Lazertag http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr;=&safe;=off&q;=%22lasertag%22&btnGSearch; on Google. 

 Rearrangement of article text to conform to wikipedia style guidlines, where applicable. 

 Replace the 'Lightgun games' wikipedia Category with 'Laser Tag', as this term is commonly used for all lightgun games, regardless of if they actually use a laser. 

 Reposition this directly under the 'Sports' category, or some new category with similar 'precision/tactic sports' pages. Any great ideas? 

 Create a section about (and new sub-category of) major Laser Tag Manufacturers, where they may get their own pages. (some already do) 

 Create sub-articles for arena laser tag and outdoor laser tag. 

 Create a category and pages for protocols (WoW, MILEStag, various proprietary systems) 

 Possibly, I can find some usable pictures, maybe create diagrams of how a common system works. Help welcome! 

 Later on, I would to get rid of the giant table, and possibly move the jargon to its own page. 

 Please note, I'm not asking anyone to do all this work (not that I mind), I will figure out the how-to's myself, but mostly just looking for any concensus or disputes before moving categories around and such."

 ==== Contested deletion == 
 (The following was copied from the deleted page Talk:Misha Bryan. Please use the proper venue for these discussions; you are welcome to re-open another review at WP:DRV if you feel the prior decision missed some key points. ~  ) 

 This page should not be speedily deleted because... (your reason here) newzealander  

 I do not understand why this article should be deleted.  The argument being used right now is that Misha Bryan is not successful enough in her own right outside of the X Factor.  But if you look at the Wikipedia:Notability guidelines, I would argue that she does sufficiently meet the guidelines for notability and should be granted her own page.   

 * She has reliable third party sources on her (albeit, there is some cleanup to be done on the bare URL's) 
 * She has significant coverage  — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •    

 ::When the article was last deleted there was also a Deletion Review (closed yesterday) which endorsed the decision.    

 :::Thanks for this link . But if I go to Wikipedia:Notability (music)#Criteria for musicians and ensembles the first reason for notability is """"Has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, published works appearing in sources that are reliable and are independent from the musician or ensemble itself.""""  Although I don't have the deleted page now to reference, if I go to List of The X Factor finalists (UK series 8) there are multiple references that are reliable sources.  Newspapers in London like the Metro and Daily Mail, the website digitalspy.com, yahoo.com, musiceyz.co.uk (a credible review of her mixtape, which would mean she is noteworthy outside of X Factor).  Now, on that same page there are a bunch of references to Misha B's twitter announcements, which would be uncredible.  And, if there were personal trivia items that would not be considered encyclopedic on the deleted page and other things to be cleaned up and deleted off the page, then that's a whole other matter.  But, if I go simply off of Wikipedia's own guidelines for musician notability, there appears to be enough there to warrant her own page.  Also, if you compare Misha Bryan to many of the finalists on this last season of American Idol, then she qualifies just as much as they do for her own page.

 ::I've been including dates in the """"Other Appearances"""" for two reasons, first because there are four Monster Manuals, three Fiend Folios, three Draconomicons, two Forgotten Realms Campaign Settings, two Monster Manual IIs, etc. and dates are an easy way to distinguish those; and second because I thought it might be useful for people to be able to easily tell which appearances came first. (I wouldn't include dates outside of that column unless I was referencing one of the repeat-name products.) You are dead right about the product codes, FRX1 and FRB1 were internal TSR codes assigned to those products, but never used on the products themselves, and TSR didn't assign codes to everything. I have only included the codes when they were actually printed on the sourcebook, but even that isn't always helpful, RR6 is mislabeled RS1, for example. I'm happy to drop the codes entirely from the cross-referencing, and perhaps only mention them under the main entry for that product. 
 I'm not sure if we should be including the name of the campaign setting as part of the product. In most cases, the campaign setting wasn't part of the official product title. """"Golden Voyages"""", for example, appears in the 1992 TSR catalog as """"ALQ1, Golden Voyages"""" (heading) and just """"Golden Voyages"""" in the descriptive text, rather than """"Al-Qadim - Golden Voyages"""". Again, however, there are exceptions to this, such as the 1993 """"Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting"""". 
 Given how frequently the product titles appear in the Other Appearances column, I suspect that the best strategy might be to keep the titles as simple as possible, i.e. just """"Golden Voyages"""" and not """"Al-Qadim - Golden Voyages"""" or """"ALQ1 - Golden Voyages"""", it shouldn't be too hard for someone to do a search for that title, and as the lists of monsters are expanded, those titles can be linked to monster listing for the cross-referenced product. 
 So, I think my proposal for a standard would be: No product codes, no campaign setting, but the year included at least for the Other Appearances references. I'm ambivalent about the italics, but tending towards worrying about those when links to those products monster lists are added ;).   """

Andre, Leadwind, and I are reverting your edit because we are supporting a consensus reached by many editors, who reached that conclusion because no historian has ever provided a historical source for Jesus' name in Hebrew or in Aramaic.  Will Durant speculated what Jesus' Hebrew or Aramaic name would have been but it is a speculation.  There is no mainstream view, because there are no historical sources.  I said this several times: N-O S-O-U-R-C-E-S.  Why do you ask me for my source when I gave as my reason the fact that there are n...o  s...o..u..r..c..e..s?  
 * You want to know the controversy I describe.  The Yeshu stories in the Talmud are considered by some modern scholars to be about Jesus (and by the way, those modern scholars do not see them as pejorative of Jesus but as reflecting through stories Jews' ambivalent feelings about Jesus and Christianity), but many modern scholars as well as medieval scholars argue that they are not about Jesus (in which case they cannot possibly be pejorative about Jesus and Christianity).  One reason why there is this controversy (is it Jesus?  is it not?) is because it is unclear what """"ha notzri"""" means - many argue that it is a reference to a religious community described by Jerimiah (long before Jesus was born, and not """"Nazarene"""").  And of course the other reason is that it is not at all clear that Yeshu or Yeshua was Jesus' name in Aramaic.  All of this controversy does not mean that Yeshu or Yeshua was not Jesus' name in Aramaic.  It does mean that we do not know.  My point was that the one case where we definitely have an Aramaic name, the earliest text with an Aramaic name one might think was Jesus's Aramaic name, there is lots of controversy as to whether this name has any connection to Jesus, and whether the name is proper Aramaic, and what the name means or who it refers to.  If there is all this controversy over the earliest texts we have with an Aramaic name, it seems to me that the most one could do today is say that Jesus' Aramaic name may have been Yeshu or Yeshua.  We just have no reliable historical documents relating to this question. 

 Without any reliable sources, any claim as to what Jesus' Hebrew or Aramaic name was would be original research, and that is forbidden by Wikipedia policy. 

 Get it?  I am not saying my sources about Jesus' are better than your and I never said my sources were better than yours (I simply pointed out what was false in some claims you made about Hebrew and Aramaic.  And that has nothing to do with someone being Jewish and someone being Christian, it was you who suggested and seem to continue to suggest that.  You are not wrong """"because"""" you are Christian.  You are just wrong.  And Christian who is also a scholar of Biblical Hebrew and of Aramaic and of Ancient Near Eastern history would also tell you you were wrong about your claims about Hebrew and Aramaic).  I am saying that THERE ARE NO HISTORICAL SOURCES AS TO JESUS"""" HEBREW OR ARAMAIC NAME so any Wikipedian making a reconstruction IS VIOLATING NOR. 

 Why do I have to repeat this?  Reread my first comment to you explaining my revert.  I continue to stand my it.  Every sentence of my first comment is true.    |   17:14, 21 January 200"

 == Extended yggdrasil and odin article == 

  
 .]] 
 : Three Norns spinning at yggdrasil]] 
 In Norse mythology, Yggdrasil (; from Old Norse Yggdrasill, pronounced ) is an immense tree that is central in Norse cosmology. It was said to be the world tree around which the nine worlds existed. Its name is generally considered to mean """"Ygg's (Odin's) horse"""". 
 Yggdrasil is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, Yggdrasil is an immense ash tree that is central and considered very holy. The gods go to Yggdrasil daily to hold their courts. The branches of Yggdrasil extend far into the heavens, and the tree is supported by three roots that extend far away into other locations; one to the well Urðarbrunnr in the heavens, one to the spring Hvergelmir, and another to the well Mímisbrunnr. Creatures live within Yggdrasil, including the wyrm (dragon) Níðhöggr, an unnamed eagle, and the stags Dáinn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr and Duraþrór. 
 Conflicting scholarly theories have been proposed about the etymology of the name Yggdrasill, the possibility that the tree is of another species than ash, the relation to tree lore and to Eurasian shamanic lore, the possible relation to the trees Mímameiðr and Læraðr, Hoddmímis hnolt, the sacred tree at Uppsala, and the fate of Yggdrasil during the events of Ragnarök. 
 ==Terminology== 
 .]] 
 The generally accepted meaning of Old Norse Yggdrasill is """"Odin's horse"""". This conclusion is drawn on the basis that drasill means """"horse"""" and Ygg(r) is one of Odin's many names. The Poetic Edda poem Hávamál describes how Odin sacrificed himself to himself by hanging from a tree, making this tree Odin's gallows. This tree may have been Yggdrasil. Gallows can be called """"the horse of the hanged"""" and therefore Odin's gallows may have developed into the expression """"Odin's horse"""", which then became the name of the tree.Simek (2007:375). 
 Nevertheless, scholarly opinions regarding the precise meaning of the name Yggdrasill vary, particularly on the issue of whether Yggdrasill is the name of the tree itself. In the Prose Edda the tree is usually not just called Yggdrasil but askr Yggdrasils. Old Norse askr means """"ash tree"""" and according to the  inflectional system of Icelandic language askr Yggdrasils means """"Yggdrasill's ash"""". Icelandic has the best preserved inflectional system of the Norse languages and the Prose Edda was also written in old Icelandic. These etymologies do though rely on a presumed but unattested *Yggsdrasill. 
 A third interpretation, presented by F. Detter, is that the name Yggdrasill refers to the word yggr (""""terror""""), yet not in reference to the Odinic name, but rather as Yggdrasill as the """"tree of terror, gallows"""". F. R. Schröder has proposed a fourth etymology according to which yggdrasill means """"yew pillar"""", deriving yggia from *igwja (meaning """"yew-tree""""), and drasill from *dher- (meaning """"support""""). 
 ==Attestations== 
 ===Poetic Edda=== 
 In the Poetic Edda, the tree is mentioned in the three poems Völuspá, Hávamál, and Grímnismál. 
 ====Völuspá==== 

 In the second stanza of the Poetic Edda poem Völuspá, the völva (a shamanic seeress) reciting the poem to the god Odin says that she remembers far back to """"early times"""", being raised by jötnar, recalls nine worlds and """"nine wood-ogresses"""" (Old Norse nío ídiðiur), and when Yggdrasil was a seed (""""glorious tree of good measure, under the ground"""").Dronke (1997:7). In stanza 19, the völva says: 

 :An ash I know there stands, 
 :Yggdrasill is its name, 
 :a tall tree, showered 
 :with shining loam."

I get the justification used, that this is something just about all of the planet does once a day at least and it should be shown.  The video on the ejaculation page is mentioned as well.  Here's the thing though, I don't think some of those wanting to post these overly graphic videos have the goal of education or providing information.  I think they get a kick out of putting what are basically scat videos off a porn site onto a major and very popular website for all to see.  And I'm not even the kind of person to get offended very easily at all, I'm not a conservative and I don't give a damn about being politically correct.  But even among children I don't think there's a person that doesn't know what it looks like to take a shit.  Maybe except for babies?  And I know the argument back will be that Wikipedia is not censored.

 Her husband's regime was corrupt and harmed the progress of democracy in Nigeria. That is marginally relevant and is pointed out in the previous version.

115715,"By the way there certainly is a Marx in anarcho-primitivism, but no anarcho-primitivism in Marx. The only anarcho-primitivism in Marx may be attributed to his war hypothesis, that only revolutions (or war) could change a society. In fact that's the main point where he completely disagreed with Heinrich Heine, who was in favor of peaceful changements of a society. Personally I think to fully understand Marx you really need to know about his relationsship with Heine. What do we learn out of this? Well, most people are able to think rational and learn by thinking, but some people aren't: They need force to change their behaviour. It's not possible to argue or reason with these kind of people. And since they favor only power, they usually get what they want. Because normal people don't want power, but love. And about the changements? Well, without the right technologies, there won't be any changement towards a more peaceful world in the future. And with the wrong technologies, the world will even become more and more anarchistic.

 == Trustworthiness ==  

 I think the section on trustworthiness misses the point.  The point it seems to make is """"this should not work at all, but it kinda looks like it seems like it might, at least so far, so meh.""""  Not exactly a ringing endorsement. 

 I would argue it will work, and it will be trustworthy, and that this type of system has been under test for about 4 billion years.  Life evolved to the working examples that it is through random mutation and natural selection.  Wikis evolve through (usually) non-random and intelligent mutation and (usually) intelligent selection based on facts.  So it should not only work as well as evolution, it should work far better and far faster.  Just like there are people who assume evolution will not work, there are people who will assume a Wiki will not work, and probably for the same reasons (well, other than religion)  because it seems complicated an esoteric with so much seemingly left to freedom and chance, when in fact the wikis are constantly selected back to the facts.  There may be some messiness and missteps along the way, but both systems will eventually arrive at working solutions. 

 I suppose, however, that at any given instant a wiki could have been vandalized and not fixed yet, so thus untrustworthy.  Unlikely, but quite possible.  So, perhaps the original section would be accurate, barring some technological solution.  Like coloring any change that is less than 24 hours old, or not reviewed or something.  Meh.

 http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/moot 

 2. of little or no practical value or meaning; purely academic. 

 There is no effective difference between the terms Commonwealth Realm and Commonwealth realm.  No country has adopted Realm as apart of their offical long-form name.  The closest invoked use of the term is the Realm of New Zealand.  The term was adopted via a Royal Letters Patent issued by the Government of New Zealand in 1983.  However, this was NOT an Act of Parliamment of New Zealand (or Great Britain and Northern Ireland), nor was it a Royal Proclaimation of New Zealand (or Great Britain and Northern Ireland).  

 The effect an offical change of the long-form name of a country within the British Commonwealth of Nations the following Order of Predecence of the ranking (highest ot lowest) of legislative instruments has been traditionally layed out as follows, 

 Royal Proclaimations, HIGHEST RANK 

 Acts of Parliament (i.e., a Statute), 

 Royal Letters Patent, 

 Royal Warrants, 

 Orders-in-Council (i.e., Cabinet Dcouments), 

 Private Communications LOWEST RANK. 

  
 The Dominion Parliaments  (post the Statute of Westminster 1931) have sole authority to change the long-form name of their respective countries.  To do so requires a legisltaive instrument of rank of an Act of Parliament (and perhaps an accompanying Royal Proclaimation).  Some examples of the countries that have exercised this right are as follows, 

 Union of South Africa (1910) changed to Republic of South Africa (1961), 

 Irish Free State (1921) changed to Republic of Ireland (1949), 

 Dominion of India (1947) changed to Republic of India (1950),   

 Dominion of Pakistan (1947) changed to Islamic Republic of Pakistan (1956).  

  
 The Colony of New Zealand offically became the Dominion of New Zealand iva a Royal Proclaimation issued by the Parliament of the United Kingdom Great Britain and Northern Ireland on September 9, 1907, and coming in force on September 26, 1907.   

 Like it or not, the offical long-form name is still the Dominion of New Zealand (or the Dominion of New Zealand and its Dependencies), and its un-offical short-form name its New Zealand (or New Zealand and its Dependencies). 

 In short, their is NO Realm of New Zealand, NOR Commonwealth Realm of New Zealand, there is ONLY Dominion of New Zealand.  Bickering over weither one should have Commonwealth Realm or Commonwealth realm is futile and fruitless.  There is NO DIFFERENCE between the terms.

 """"The September 11 attacks [...] were a series of four suicide attacks that were committed in the United States on September 11, 2001[...]"""" 

 False. They were not suicide attacks; any honest person who has seriously researched this atrocity would realize that the US military used cruise missiles on the towers; and then the government lied and pinned the blame on Muslims, so it could justify wars in Afghanistan and Iraq - and also so it could justify illegal security and secret police actions against its own citizens. 

 """"The hijackers also intentionally crashed American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and intended to pilot the fourth hijacked jet, United Airlines Flight 93, into the United States Capitol Building[2] in Washington, D.C.; however, the plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania after its passengers attempted to take control of the jet from the hijackers."""" 

 Nonsense. The only hijacked planes anyone saw on the day were TV animations on the broadcast news. Don't believe me? Go look for yourself at the news broadcasts and then come back to me and try to make excuses why the planes didn't even fly into the buildings from consistent directions. 

 """"Suspicion quickly fell on al-Qaeda[...]""""

 ===Hello Kils=== 
 Just would like to state that i have very much enjoyed being involved in a project of this nature. To see the speed of co-operation between various people was (Uwe, Lupo and Salleman and all others) fantastic. It was a complete buzz to go off researching about a scientific subject and coming to some understanding and appreciation of a creature that i would have no  
 knowledge or interest in otherwise. I would like to say that it takes a damn good teacher to get others interested in what they teach and i for one, if only in a rudimentary and general way have found the subject of Krill and sorrounding issues of ecology and environment fascinating. I think that says a lot about your willingness to let others participate in something which you obviously have great knowledge in and could easily have been a lot less humble with.  
 At some point i will put up some informtion on my home page so at least people know a little more about me. 
 Am going to try to extend the article on Ice-algae so any info you may have would be good.

 I am confused  by the latest edit by  adding in final para Although the Standells™ have gone through various incarnations over the years (with Tony Valentino being the only member to never have left the band), but, since he is not in the current lineup, did the band thus leave him?  Then there's the WP:PEA-worthy Their impact on the musical space-time continuum is immense, and the assertion of popular opinion  - clearly, the band's core line-up recognized by the public (and has secondary meaning). 

 Also the addition of tm and registration symbols throughout is just a little over the top, and I am guessing not in keeping with WP:MOS. 

 So I am fixing those things, and done a general clean up. thus.

 Much of the article is primary research, and thus subject to more scrutiny than usual as to secondary references.

 Larry Tamblyn did  to trademark The Standells name  in 2009, granted in 2010.

 == What the...?!  (Proposal to clarify or delete paragraph from article) == 
 Can't believe nobody's brought this paragraph up for discussion, as I was sure it would be edited out of the article by now: 

 <> 

 For one thing, it seems to be misworded or badly edited.  Androphiles are persons of any sex or gender identity who are attracted to men.  The writer doesn't support the declaration of the final sentence with the previous two.  Is the author's point that gay men aren't attracted to all types of men, but rather to men whose sexual image is either stereotypically gay (even if not actually gay or bisexual, like some of the boybanders people keep putting up here), or iconically straight (even if actually gay or bisexual, like Rock Hudson or James Dean), thereby excluding types of men more typical to the gender, such as Eisenhower or whomever this Garlits character is?  And who is the author of that paragraph to imply that gay men not attracted to Iggy Pop or Muhammad Ali?  I'd say the sexual component to both of those men's appeal was within the realm of that appreciated by some gays, if not to the level of gay iconography.  On the other hand, Iggy Pop has always been cited as one of the major proponents of androgyny, alongside David Bowie and Marc Bolan, and as such would have a fairly iconic stature affecting the sexual or gender identities of some who grew up with him as an influence.  So if that was the writer's point, the glam Iggy Pop - or for that matter, the very vain and rather handsome Muhammad Ali, who spouted poetry about his own physical beauty - would seem to be out of place, as they do have a sexual appeal to certain segments of the gay community, and therefore don't support that point. 

 The only way it makes sense as I read it is if Eisenhower, Einstein and the rest ARE gay icons yet gay icons whose appeal is not explained by the definition.  Yet...is there a subculture of gays who would cite Eisenhower, Einstein and Garlits as chief among their icons?!  (""""Drag racing legend"""" seems to me about as synonymous with """"gay icon"""" as """"Aboriginal spear-thrower.""""  Less, as at least the Aborigine shows some skin.)  Finally, the writer doesn't make the point that gay icons are limited to celebrities by citing other celebrities - Bella Abzug or Harvey Milk, while known personages and people who fought for the rights of women and gays (and thereby candidates for iconic appreciation), were not celebrity-famous, and neither classically attractive nor part of a trendy subculture, and would more appropriately festoon (?!) a list of those lamentably relegated to would-be icons but for the fact they're not celebrities, if that was the point.  Could the original writer, or someone who understands and can explain this point clearly, help me and others understand what this statement means, so that we can clarify that point in the article?  If not, I propose it be removed.   """

 == Re: Hollaback Girl == 

 Don't give up; you can't make a nomination end prematurely (at least I don't think so), so it's going to sit there for at least a few more days. One big thing people are looking for is more information on how the song was made ,and its importance in pop culture outside of its sales statistics and music video, which are ususally small elements of a popular song's legacy (the exceptions are videos by people like Michael Jackson). Being a number-one song, I'm sure places like MTV.com and VH1.com have articles about Stefani and the song, and she has to have done some magazine interviews (Rolling Stone, Spin, Blender, etc.) on the song and/or her album. Basically, information on why the song is important outside of its success. You should especially see if you can find some user reviews online of the song, to give an indication of its significant popularity in dance clubs (I've seen people lose their minds when """"Hollaback Girl"""" comes on in a club). Also, since the Neptunes' stamp is so firmly imprinted into the song, a comparison (or at least a mention) of similar-sounding records the Neptunes have produced (several Kelis songs, """"Shake Ya Ass"""" by [[Mystikal], and, for the minimalist effect, """"Grindin'"""" by the Clipse come to mind, but there are probably more and better examples). 

 The other big thing is that it needs a rewrite. Most of the article reads typical of the work of another Wikipedia user, who was known for writing long articles on pop songs that always needed prose cleanup (and he would often scream bloody murder whenever anyone would try). The big difference between the articles for """"Hollaback Girl"""" and """"Cool"""" are that Cool (song) goes into detail about why the song is important (it's about Stefani's personal life, and it explains how and why). """"Hollaback Girl"""" isn't as personal or deep, true, but it's not a meaningless song at all. 

 Just don't give up so early.  """

 == This entry is pathetic. == 

 This article needs to be completely wiped out and rewritten by someone who actually knows what they are talking about.  I and other teachers around the world would be hard-pressed to endorse this entry as a credible authority on the teaching profession.  Teachers, remember this:  Future teachers are likely to come here to seek information on the profession.  Let's keep it apolitical and objective.   

 From reading the discussions taking place on the talk page, I can see that there are many (primarily Eurocentric and anti-American) biases at work and find it deeply concerning (""""What the hell is the apple about?"""" etc.).  Considering this is an article about TEACHERS and not about international benchmarks of student performance, it is incredibly dubious to include Alan Greenspan's speculative suggestions for better student performance in the United States.  Also, Greenspan is NOT a pedagogue  he is an ECONOMIST.  He is not a reliable source of information on the teaching profession.  A good teacher knows what a good source is, so let's try to find a couple of good sources and leave Greenspan to his book-keeping.  It is for this reason that I am compelled to remove the Greenspan paraphrase/passage. 

 What we want to show here is WHAT a teacher IS and WHAT a teacher DOES, which is for the most part universal across the board.  This childish nitpicking over what this country does and how poorly or well this country does and how well or poorly teachers are paid is out of order.  Leave the misguided politics in the pubs and teachers' lounges.Bold text  It is impossible in this entry to do justice to the teaching profession in all of these diverse nations, each with unique educational landscapes and concerns.

 == The problem with this """"paradox""""... == 

 The following section was originally under they are here unobserved section, but does not fit this description as it is claiming observations and intentional communication are occurring, albeit via non-ordinary modes of biological consciousness, instead of electromagnetic radiation.  Hence, I created a new category as follows:  Also, restored the deleted material on Terence McKenna, since it is quite germane as the point of this section of the article is to discuss modes of thought alien to our own, that we may well not recognize or be unjustifiably dismissing as 'ridiculous', which McKenna was the exemplar of. 

 :... and they are communicating, but not via radio waves  

 :A related series of views consider that alien entities have been communicating with humans throughout history, but utilizing methods and technologies that are non-electromagnetic in nature, perceivable via what are conventionally known as altered states, which are outside most people's experience or imagination. """"Signals"""" are arriving, but only a few individuals perceive them, and then rarely and possibly in a distorted manner. Accounts of communication have perhaps been reported in ancient religious texts (accounting for the wide variety of anecdotal reports of angels, demons, and so on) but have been dismissed or overlooked. 

 :As an example: if the human brain utilizes quantum mechanical processes in its operation (as theorized by Roger Penrose, Stuart Hameroff, and others) then it may be open to receiving some form  of nonlocal """"psychic"""" communication, perhaps using quantum entanglement. It has been proposed that some accounts of mystics, shamans, schizophrenics, and channelers may be such """"garbled"""" communications, transmitted by non-human intelligences in this manner. According to quantum mechanics the transfer of information in the context of information theory is not possible using quantum nonlocal correlations. However, supporters of the idea of this form of communication idea believe that this may explain the """"garbled"""", associative, and inspirational nature of the """"messages"""" recorded in the world's religious and anthropological history. This idea also explains the evident absence of space travel, which is unnecessary to the community of alien intelligence communicating via this medium.  

 :However, the theories of Penrose, Hameroff, and others are not universally accepted, and have met with skepticism, nor has it yet been shown that quantum mechanical effects are required for consciousness to occur. 

 :Another useful example of a theoretical means of communication that would appear so very alien to most people's way of thinking, that it would most likely be misinterpreted or dismissed outright, is the controversial proposals of Terence McKenna that the psychoactive drugs psilocybin and/or Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is an alien technology, """"seeded"""" here on Earth by non-human intelligence, as part of a """"biological communication strategy"""", in order to alter the perceptive processes of the human mind so that it may receive messages being transmitted to us."""

 Hi Excirial- 

 This is in regards to the decline of my submission: Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/NYC Outward Bound Schools. The reasoning given was that it wasn't written in an encyclopedic tone, didn't use unbiased sources, and used value-laden language (my wording, as I can't find the decline page right now!). I'm hoping you can help me by giving me a few specific lines and/or particularly problematic sections? I've used 28 published references in the article, including 3 New York Times articles, a New York Times Magazine article, a New York Observer article, a New York Post article, 2 Newsday articles, a Miami Herald article, several articles from academic journals, and several books from established publishers like Teachers College Press, Public Affairs Books, and Middle Atlantic Press. 

 There are about 3 sections where I try to describe the organization's mission, values, goals and results, and I will admit that it was harder there to keep an encyclopedic tone. In the few places where assertions are made without references, I've tried to qualify the language using terms like """"The organization espouses a goal of doing XYZ"""" rather than """"The organization delivers quality educational experiences"""", etc. And I have really tried to not use superlatives and value-charged adjectives. 
 Can you please give me some sections and examples for me to look at and suggestions for how to improve? 

 Thanks, Carol NYCOBuser

 The article on Arbella Stuart mentions — but does not identify by name — a Duke of Parma, a Pope, a cardinal who was the Pope's brother, as well as the kings of France, Spain and Poland. I want to identify and make links for the Pope, cardinal and kings mentioned in the article. 

 My sketchy memory of the names of European leaders of the late 16th and early 17th centuries makes me ask these questions: 

 :Is the King of France Henry IV? 
 :Is the King of Spain Philip III? 
 :Is the Pope Clement VIII? Did he have a brother who was a cardinal? Was that cardinal really defrocked in order to marry Arbella Stuart? 
 :And who are the Duke of Parma and King of Poland mentioned in the article? 

 I would appreciate someone who knows more about the period to find out and add the appropriate links to the article. Many thanks.

73224,""" Is the NHC Awake? == 

 First off, they should have marked Tammy as a depression before turning into a tropical storm. Now, the miss Vince as a depression almost a tropical storm but luckily they have it for a hurricane.  So the questions is: Anyone awake at the NHC?  

 :No, Tammy should not have been marked as a depression. When it acquired tropical characteristics, its winds were already at tropical storm force, so it wasn't a depression when the NHC issued its first advisory. No, they are not sleeping. Vince is a remarkable entity that is not something anybody expected to monitor. Also keep in mind that, like you and me, the NHC is not perfect, but they do a darned good job. —  

 ::Well even if Tammy didn't have tropical characteristics it could have been labeled a suptropical storm.  As for Vince maybe it's the fact that it's not close to the Western Hemisphere and so no body tends to pay attention.  Again, it's all ethnocentrism at work and you cannot question that.  

 :::OK. First, Tammy didn't have a circulation before it was upgraded, but on the morning of whatever day it was, visible satellite showed a circulation. Since winds were high, it could bypass the depression stage. Second, what if Vince didn't develop any more? What if it had well organized convection, and it dissipated? They said in the outlooks that it would be monitored for more organization, and when they upgraded, it was better organized. They are not sleeping, they don't want to upgrade something that might just dissipate. What if they upgraded Tammy as a Subtropical Storm, but it never got a well-organized circulation? They would raise hype for nothing. Any other storms you have a problem with?   

 I think they already admitted they missed Vince.  I'm guessing because it was out in the middle of nowhere they didn't even think to investigate it until the satellite images showed it had clearly taken tropical attributes.   

 Okay, first I have no problems with storms. The NHC has monitored depression even if they don't develop but it's the fact that they could is why they monitor them.  Unless of course you didn't catch that in their job description.  I am not shooting down the NHC I am giving them construtivce critism.  They are after all in charge of informing us about potential dangerous storms.  So Hurricanehink maybe you should read between the lines.   

 : To be a tropical cyclone, a system must have 
 :* A closed surface circulation; 
 :* Organized thunderstorm activity; and 
 :* A warm core. 
 : If the first two conditions are met but the storm lacks a warm core it may be classified as a subtropical storm.  Tammy was a strong low pressure system but lacked a closed surface circulation until the morning of Oct. 5.  The NHC had been mentioning it in their Topiclal Weather Outlook bullitens, but until it gained a closed circulation they could not classify it as a tropical cyclone.  You should look at the histories of tropical storms.  Most tropical cyclones start out as tropical cylones with 25 or 30 kt winds.  So only minimal strengthenning (to 35 kt) is needed to have them qualify as a tropical storm.  As was the case with Tammy, it is possible for a system to become tropical when it already has 35 kt or greater winds, in which case it immediately is a tropical storm.  This is not usual, but it does happen. 
 : So I assure you that the NHC was on top of Tammy.  If there are areas of concern, they are the way Vince sneaked up on them, and perhaps more so the hurricane that struck Brazil in March 2004.  (It seems that noone is responsible for the South Atlantic, which is unfortuate given that hurricanes while rare there do on occasion happen.)  |   

 ::Then why not mention it as a subtropical cyclone? That's the point I'm getting to.  

 ::: I will assume that you are refering to Tammy.  Until the morning of 10/5, Tammy lacked a closed circulation, and therefore was not a cyclone of either the tropical or subtropical variety.  Period.  Whether you approve of it or not, the NHC got Tammy right.  |   

 ::By the way has anyone seen the NHC lately? Their graphics seem to end close to Europe and Africa you can see it for wind prob. and tracking for Vince. 

 This argument is crazy. Whoever acused the NHC with being asleep should be ashamed of themselves. The guys at the NHC work around the clock to keep us safe. Without them, hundreds of thousands instead of a thousand would be dead in New Orleans ri"

 Hello , I would like to answer in regarding to the topic Serbs of Croatia. If you look at this previous discussion you will see the very same pattern. Serbian orthodox church was established in 1920 and this user tried to push the edit that Tesla's father was Serbian orthodox priest, a non-existent term in the 19th century. Much in the same manner, he posted sources that simply bring the claim. That was finally resolved with a RfC so maybe that is the way to go here. I think your edit is right and that other's are pushing Serbian POV, not just POV but Serbian wartime propaganda. I suggest you gather your sources which reference the primary source and elaborate on the matter and open a RfC. There you can state that all of the sources that say otherwise do not bring any reference or any quote from the primary source. Also I think that another edit should state that although that claim was much publicized during wartime, it was never put before the Badinter's commission which was established just for that cases, to deal with legal questions. That clearly shows that this was nothing but a wartime propaganda. It only surprises that there are people still repeating it. I don't think you will be able to discuss in good faith with those people. I tried and you saw what happened to me. A discussion in good faith would be similar to the one I purposed. I don't know if you saw my last message, so I will repeat an argument I made which is pretty solid from the logical point of view: We have 2 identical terms from Yugoslav and from SRC constitution that specify who constituted a state (SFRY,SRC). Yugoslav constitution says: """"Yugoslav nations,..., along with nationalities...have created SFRY"""" while SRC constitution says: """"Croatian nation, along with Serbian nationa and nationalities in Croatia...constituted SRFY"""". The use of """"along with"""" is a standard legal formulation to specify the subject, but not to neglect the """"others"""". In my opinion this is the main point of interest. The sentence you are pointing out (national state of Croatians...) is just derived from that definition. However this is an interpretation of the source, and you could point this arguments if you had someone who discusses in good faith. There's not much point into mentioning this arguments when you are discussing with POV pushers. The best way is to open a RfC and briefly elaborate the issue that one group of sources say something but does not give any elaboration or any reference to the primary source and that another group of the sources says something opposite, and directly references the primary source. Also point out that Tuvixer is interpreting the source. The fact that does not bother FkpCascais while on the other hand he is heavily attacking you that you are the one interpreting. In fact, if you go to the beginning of the discussion, you will see that before FkpCascais had presented any source as the basis for his opinion he said: """"I share passion for law and I fully agree with Tuvixer in his interpretation."""". He had no problem into accepting the """"interpretation"""" of the primary source whilst he now has strong objections. At the point he posted his first comment your sources were the only one presented, and yet he disregarded them for an interpretation of the primary source, he even made his own interpretations. I mean what, if that does not point out that he is not discussing in good faith, what else? If you look at his past discussions you will see that he and the same group of people always appear and push Serbian POV while accusing the other side of POV pushing. At the end, if you don't back down, you turn out to be the pusher because it's simply more of them. In any case, I suggest you don't get involved too much since FkpCascais already started with the same pattern of accusations that you are a pusher. He writes them every now and then, so at the end it really seems like you are pushing. You will get blocked if you get too involved and that's what happened to several other people dealing with this group of editors who seem to be present of Croatian articles, pushing Serbian POV.

 #, (whom I never thanked, but do no), had understood my note in the tone it was written, and intervened in my favor. 
 # stepped in qualifying my message of “uncivil behavior”, which it was not. 
 #The person who had been offended by my words went on Serge Woodzing talk page & thanked him.  Again, the “message full of hatred” was mentioned, then  “that particular contributor” who was the “worst nightmare” Mr. Woodzing “had ever had so far”.  
 #Since Mr. Woodzing and myself had had a few sharp exchanges a few months earlier on a royalty page, I took his “nightmare” to be me.   

 Mr. Woodzing, this sounds more to me like a comedy of errors, and now you call me a “problem” & want me to apologize. I always apologize, but only for my faults.  In this instance, and in view of the circumstances, the time and the strange writing that made it sound as if I was your """"worst nightmare"""", what fault did I make toward you that demands an apology on my part?

 """"Furthermore they achieve one key green-building goal of reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions for the life of the building not all types of passive houses can be considered """"green"""" in other areas because of the heavy use of artificial materials, insulators and finishes (which slowly decompose naturally),"""" 

 Comparatively passive houses don't use significantly more materials and there is no specific need to use 'artificial' materials as a passive house can be made fully from timber/wood fibre or other natural materials. The embodied energy in a building is small in comparison to it's total lifetime energy consumption. These are not specific criticisms of the passive house approach. 

  
  """"...high energy consumption and environmental impact for producing building blocks off-site and transporting them on-site for prefabricated houses.""""  

 Producing blocks off site isn't a SPECIFIC criticism of a passive house. All buildings (even earthships) need some kind of building material transported to site, once again an unspecific criticism, a criticism of building in general. 

  
 """"Additionally, setting up a passive house (still) requires revamping of the natural environment of the building site and ground for house foundation (especially for underground heat exchanger)."""" 

 An underground heat exchanger is not a necessity of a passive house. Once again almost EVERY building needs some kind of ground work to occur, this is a criticism of building in general and not PH specifically.

 == The State of the Nigeria union == 

 :As a faithful and passionate Nigerian, after reading several Nigerian newspapers online,  like The Punch, Nigerian Tribune, The Sun, Sahara Report, I am very happy with  
 overtures going on in our country political atmosphere. I have to admit that though it might not be exactly what we want it to be, you will agree with me that it’s good for the politics of the nation.  The 2011 general election is around the corner; politicians are running for their lives, making each other run for their money, or should I say “looted money;” the old garrison politicians are running to their political godfathers and the new ones are strategizing to stage an upset, while our good ol’ PDP is still fighting over its zoning argument. However, as a future leader, and a lover of politics, I am happy for the country. I must confess, I love this current wave of politics in the country, and I will tell you why. Our beautiful country, Nigeria is now 50th, the hype both home and abroad is remarkable. Though, people like me might say “why and what are we celebrating?"""" The reality can’t be changed: Nigeria is 50 years old. Of course, there are many questions to be asked, many things to be fixed, many leaders to be recycled, if not jailed, but we are still here. We survived 50 years of troubles and lootings. Nigeria has survived 50 years of poverty. 
 :However, in readiness and preparation for the 2011 general election, our “new” INEC released its timetable for election. I must confess, when I first saw the timetable I was  
 overwrought. I was so agitated to the extent that the bad news suddenly became normal to me. I found myself asking how can we hold an election in January of 2011, a few months away? It is no brainer that to hold a reliable, free, and fair election, we must give all political parties an ample amount of time. I was disappointed and aggravated that our so-called INEC who prized itself to deliver free and fair election could come up with a timetable that is as unrealistic as that. However, just when I had accepted my faith and I was beginning to roll with the punches, figuring out how to volunteer for a candidate of my choice, Uncle INEC changed his mind. Yay! I read now that the election will no longer be held in January, but later in March or April. As a new-breed and progressive Nigerian, I am flabbergasted. I strongly believe that in order to hold or organize any type of election, we must start preparing at least two years before the time, therefore, allowing all the political parties and their candidates to prepare, raise money, and campaign rigorously. 
 :Consequentially, in recent weeks, I have been so hyped, dancing and singing praises about the prospect of the election. I was enamored with the way all of our presidential  
 candidates declared their interest. In retrospect, I can’t recall the last time I got so carried away like this. In my book, 2011 presidential election is a must watch for every Nigerian. It is not just an election; it is an election that speaks volume. This election will feature and present change in some form. Take a look at some of the major presidential candidates so far: we have the president himself, President Jonathan Goodluck of People Democratic Party (PDP), Mallam Nuhu Ribadu of Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), Chief Dele Momodu of Labour Party (LP), Kwara State Governor Bukola Saraki of People Democratic Party (PDP), Ex vice president Atiku of PDP, “The General himself” Ibrahim Babangida of People Democratic Party (PDP), our pastor, Pastor Chris Okotie of the Fresh Democratic Party (FDP), Pat Utomi of the Social Democratic Mega Party (SDMP), and General Aliyu Gusau of PDP. Though party presidential primaries are yet to take place, but the buzz these aforementioned candidates have generated is momentous.  While PDP skirmishes its zoning arrangement, Labour Party, Action Congress of Nigeria, and the rest of the oppositions are ready to battle, I believe. One thing that crossed my mind while I was gearing myself up for the forth coming election, however, is the question I asked myself: how sweet and awesome it would have been, if the likes of Atiku, Babangida, Bukola Saraki, Aliyu Gusau, and President Jonathan were all from a different party contesting against each other? I guess some day, maybe next time, and next election. 
 :Nonetheless, working with what we have as at now, with primary elections yet to take place, I love what is going on. I love the fact that this coming election might witness an  
 unprecedented voters' turn out and even an upset. Putting my objective opinions and feelings aside on each candidates, I strong believe that an upset is highly possible. Let’s imagine for a second that candidate Ribadu of ACN or Dele Momodu of LP wins the election, that will be a huge upset and an “in your face” moment to the garrison establishment.

 Allopathic treatments often require increasing doses of anti-fungal medications each visit just to keep fungal overgrowth symptoms from getting worse.  A result of these treatments are new strains of """"-azole resistant Candida"""" you've been reading about on Google Scholar.

 I guess that most of the North American mestizos come from Cherokees (the rest of the White/Black mixes with Indians are probably classed as some kind of Indian).

 Hello, 

 I've tried 3 times (twice with Wordpress and once with no login) to reply to the wllm.com blog, but none of the replies have shown up.  Am I doing something wrong? - The non-appearing posts were calm, non-insulting, perhaps even boring, but I didn't save them before posting and I don't want to type them again and have them not show up. 

 We have not conversed before anywhere - I did sign up on Wikipediocracy a while ago to post a picture of Gordon Ramsey choking Greg Kohs, but by the time I finished signing up, the discussion had moved on and I never did post the photo there or post at all.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •    

 Thanks, 
 Entlebucherdoodle. 
 : I'll check it out. Sometimes they go to a spam folder for various reasons.   

 ::Thanks - I can't remember the exact text, but I think there was a  < B > and a < /B > in there somewhere.     

 :::Thanks I was able to post on wllm.com - I think that when I remember/find my Wikipediocracy login information, that I will finally post the photo of Gordon Ramsey choking Greg Kohs on Wikipediocracy, I don't know where else to post it.  It is tasteful and not violent - Greg is smiling.    
 :::: It sounds like a pretty funny pic. I started a thread a while back while I was getting data points on whether Greg posing a threat at WikiConference 2014 was credible. Coincidentally, it was where I found out about the infamous boldfacing. He had apologized for it by that time. Then he unfortunately voided that apology as far as I'm concerned with his referring back to it an unapologetic way, although I did not- and still don't- believe he poses any physical threat whatsoever. In any case, I called it """"The Roast of Greg Kohs,"""" and it was pretty tame but for that one instance. He posted a picture of him posing next to a roast chicken. I suggest posting it on that thread.   
 :::::The roast chicken thread was where I was going to post the Gordon Ramsey Choking Greg Kohs photo (an actual non-photoshopped image) but by the time I had my Wikipediocracy account set up, the thread had moved on.  Did you ask Greg Kohs for his side of the """"he got"""" text before you made the """"Greg Kohs and Bigotry"""" blog post?  I frequently see text on legitimate journalism sites and newspapers such as """"xxxx did not reply to requests for comments before this issue went to print.""""  I understand that blogs don't have to have the same ethics as mainstream journalists, so that may be the reason.  It would be a lot of work if all the blogs on the internet were required try to get both sides of any post they made and they would be less popular.  I tried to read Donald Rumsfeld's autobiography some time ago and it was somewhat boring to read because on all of the major issues he would explain both sides of each argument to be made for actions that he took.  It would have been a much more """"enjoyable"""" read if he discussed only the reasons """"for"""" his actions and had left out the """"against"""" arguments.  So, I can understand why on your own blog you would present your own views on issues without trying to contact the subject of a defamatory blog post to get their side prior to publishing the post - if anyone wants to present their own side, they can set up their own blog"""".

 Hi, 

 I am a member of the Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle specialist group and over the last few years they have been producing web available pdf's which are accounts on every species of turtle. Its a long term project they have now done about half of them.as an example of one of these please see one I am an author on Chelodina burrungandjii. I have been thinking that writing accounts for each species on wikipedia is a bit of reinventing the wheel. I may be able to get permission to use these pdf's on here as major resources. If I was to get this permission from the editorial board of Chelonian Conservation and Biology, which would include images and distribution maps etc, what would I need from them so it would not be considered plagiarism.

102925,"""Food security refers to the availability of food and one's access to it. A household is considered food-secure when its occupants do not live in hunger or fear of starvation. According to the World Resources Institute, global per capita food production has been increasing substantially for the past several decades.[1] In 2006, MSNBC reported that globally, the number of people who are overweight has surpassed the number who are undernourished - the world had more than one billion people who were overweight, and an estimated 800 million who were undernourished.[2] According to a 2004 article from the BBC, China, the world's most populous country, is suffering from an obesity epidemic.[3] In India, the second-most populous country in the world, 30 million people have been added to the ranks of the hungry since the mid-1990s and 46% of children are underweight.[4] 

 Worldwide around 852 million people are chronically hungry due to extreme poverty, while up to 2 billion people lack food security intermittently due to varying degrees of poverty (source: FAO, 2003). Six million children die of hunger every year - 17,000 every day.[5] As of late 2007, export restrictions and panic buying, US Dollar Depreciation,[6] increased farming for use in biofuels,[7] world oil prices at more than $100 a barrel,[8] global population growth,[9] climate change,[10] loss of agricultural land to residential and industrial development,[11][12] and growing consumer demand in China and India[13] are claimed to have pushed up the price of grain.[14][15] However, the role of some of these factors is under debate. Some argue the role of biofuel has been overplayed[16] as grain prices have come down to the levels of 2006. Nonetheless, food riots have recently taken place in many countries across the world.[17][18][19] 

 It is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain food security in a world beset by a confluence of """"peak"""" phenomena, namely peak oil, peak water, peak phosphorus, peak grain and peak fish. Approximately 3.3 billion people, more than half of the planet's population, live in urban areas as of November 2007. Any disruption to farm supplies may precipitate a uniquely urban food crisis in a relatively short time.[20] The ongoing global credit crisis has affected farm credits, despite a boom in commodity prices.[21] Food security is a complex topic, standing at the intersection of many disciplines. 

 A new peer-reviewed journal of Food Security: The Science, Sociology and Economics of Food Production and Access to Food began publishing in 2009.[22] In developing countries, often 70% or more of the population lives in rural areas. 

 In the US, there are approximately 2,000,000 farmers, less than 1% of the population. A direct relationship exists between food consumption levels and poverty. Families with the financial resources to escape extreme poverty rarely suffer from chronic hunger, while poor families not only suffer the most from chronic hunger, but are also the segment of the population most at risk during food shortages and famines. 

 Two commonly used definitions of food security come from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA):"""

12023,"*Unfortunately, I do not have too much that I can point to in reliable sources.  From what I know, the Sato stuff is probably correct.  Before he came to SOA, Irimajiri was brought into SOJ as executive VP specifically to focus on the consumer business because Nakayama's expertise was in the arcades.  I believe I read in an article that this is the reason he initiated the Dreamcast project from the US: he still saw himself as the consumer point man.  I will have to check my files on that to be sure.  When I interviewed Bernie Stolar, he claimed Irimajiri initiated the project because of a lack of faith in Sato.  My work is not published yet, so that can't be used in Wikipedia, but I just throw it out there as something that confirms some of what your other sources claim. 

 :As for ending Dreamcast, when I interviewed Stolar and Kalinske, they both pointed to Okawa as the main actor in getting Sega out of hardware.  This makes sense, as I have interviewed every American SOA president from Bruce Lowry to Bernie Stolar, and Stolar is the only one that indicated Okawa took an active role in the company's affairs despite being the chairman of SOJ from 1984 until his death (and briefly president after Irimajiri).  I think that both Nakayama and Irimajiri were both interested in keeping Sega in console hardware, but in the face of increasing losses Okawa, a software guy himself as head of a computer services company, and the Sega board members representing Sega's bank joined forces to oust them both in turn and then end the hardware business.  That is certainly the angle I plan to focus on in my own work, but, again, it's not published yet and I am still getting my sources in order on some of those points.  I know that's not much concrete info, but I hope it at least helps focus your efforts.

 ::You are correct, I think the United Nations is a ridiculous organization.  One of its primary reasons for creation was to make sure a Holocaust never happened again.  Just like your belief that sometimes murder is justified (for the record, not all killing is murder, but I won't use scare quotes around the word because I think that's childish in a debate with someone), I am an idealist about some things, and genocide is one.  That might be surprising considering my other statements, but systematic extermination does boil my blood.  My major problem with Clinton was his turning a blind eye to Rwanda, a case where I wouldn't have minded losing American lives to ensure the slaughter ended.  It's an issue almost totally ignored here in the States, and in relation to the United Nations. (It's also my main problem with Bush, his ignoring of the Sudan """"crisis"""" - I use scare quotes there, because it's obviously a genocide.)  It has to do with the motives behind the killing, I think, that makes me so angry/upset.  We killed far more Vietnamese with bombs than the soldiers did in My Lai, but My Lai is the one that pisses me off.  The Japanese killed 3000 Americans at Pearl Harbor, but the Rape of Nanking gets me more upset.  And don't get me started on the Holocaust, there's no words to describe my feelings for that crime.  I could probably find more instances where the deaths of non-Americans upset me more than Americans, but none pop immediately to mind. 

 ::Oh, and I forgot to say this in all my other replies, but I'm not a realist as it applies to that school of geopolitics.  I meant that I usually realize that my ideals are sometimes ridiculously out of line with how the real world functions.

 ==African Americans and Colon Cleansing== 

 Colon cleansing is becoming increasingly popular in the African-American Community.  Negro people are the major customers of colon cleansing producers.  Nobody is sure about why blacks are obsessed with the cleanliness of their colons.  Some speculate that it is a superstition brought over from Africa by the slaves.  Perhaps it has something to do with the emancipation proclamation.  Every negro deserves a donkey and a bucket to eliminate in, according to the Articles of Reconstruction.  This lead to the binge and purge mentality of blacks.  In some health food stores, black women are called """"Saturday Night Specials,"""" because they love to come in on Saturday night to get their colon cleansers.  A week of KFC has them plugged up, and they need to eliminate the greasy waste so their shacked up boyfriends can have better anal sex, unless they are planning on having another welfare baby.  Many nutritionists, including Mike Hunt attribute this phenomena to the typical diet of fried chicken, and the increasing price of watermelon.  Economist Raj Sahib says has indicated that watermelon sales in the inner-city have an inverse relationship to prices, and that as watermelon consumption declines, the use of habit forming colon cleansers increases.  Mike Hunt states that Afro-Americans have a higher risk of colon cancer as a direct result of their consumption of mass quantities fried chicken, literally buckets full per household on a daily basis in the typical negro apartment.  Combine this with drinking a forty of Eight-Ball (malt liquor sold by """"the man"""" in our communities to enslave our brothers) on the porch, smokin some menthols, and some chronic, and you have a receipe for disaster."""
